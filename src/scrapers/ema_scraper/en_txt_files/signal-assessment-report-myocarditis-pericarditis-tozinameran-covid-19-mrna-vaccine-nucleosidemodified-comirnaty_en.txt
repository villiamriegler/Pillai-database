Background 
This signal was triggered by the MPA following the circulation of the preliminary results dated 5th 
October 2021 of a study entitled SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and risk of pericarditis and myocarditis: 
Nordic nationwide cohort study of 20 million individuals. The analyses were undertaken within a 
request from the Swedish government to the Medical Products Agency of in depth safety evaluation of 
covid-19 vaccines. 
The report is based on a meta-analysis of data from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis have been followed specifically due to the previous signal of these events. 
1.  Initial evidence 
1.1.  Signal validation  
The preliminary analyses of the abovementioned study show that the occurrence of myocarditis is 
more frequent after the second vaccine dose, than after the first, and in younger men. Analyses are 
ongoing to further characterize these risks, which include similar analyses of pericarditis. 
The previous PRAC recommendation was mainly based on data from spontaneous reporting. The new 
data, based on national population registers, linked to vaccination and health care registries in the 
respective countries, contribute with new information regarding the magnitude of risk for the two 
respective vaccines, including in different age strata. 
Prompt evaluation on the need for updates on e.g. the product information for these respective 
vaccines is proposed. 
The triggering MS noted that these data can be important for ongoing vaccination campaigns. 
Based the preliminary results the triggering MS concluded regarding Comirnaty the following 
(summarised): 
• 
• 
2nd dose is not strongly associated with myocarditis in the general Nordic populations. 
2nd dose is associated with myocarditis in men 18-39 – however the absolute number of cases 
is still low. 
• 
1st and 2nd dose are associated with myocarditis in boys 12-17 – however the absolute number 
of cases is still low. 
• 
• 
• 
Estimates in men 18-39 yrs are far from precise but are consistent over countries 
2nd dose is associated with pericarditis in men 18-39 
SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with myocarditis, more strongly in those 40 years and older 
Evaluation of potential biases (i.e. ascertainment bias, residual confounding, confounding by age and 
by calendar-time) are still ongoing. 
1.2.  Signal confirmation  
As the previous PRAC recommendation (July 2021) was mainly based on data from spontaneous 
reporting from outside the EEA, the new data, based on Scandinavian national population registers 
4 
 
 
 
 
linked to vaccination and health care registries in the respective countries, contribute with new 
information regarding the magnitude of risk for the two respective vaccines, including in different age 
strata although estimates in several strata are based on low numbers. 
The current product information contains the following warning in SmPC section 4.4: 
Myocarditis and pericarditis  
Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed following vaccination with Comirnaty. 
These cases have primarily occurred within 14 days following vaccination, more often after the second 
vaccination, and more often in younger men. Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis and 
pericarditis following vaccination is not different from myocarditis or pericarditis in general.  
Healthcare  professionals  should  be  alert  to  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  myocarditis  and  pericarditis. 
Vaccinees should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative 
of  myocarditis  or  pericarditis  such  as  (acute  and  persisting)  chest  pain,  shortness  of  breath,  or 
palpitations following vaccination.  
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition. 
Both  myocarditis  and  pericarditis  are  currently  listed  in  SmPC  Section  4.8  as  adverse  reactions  with 
frequency category ‘Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)’. 
In view of the new information on the magnitude of the risk and the current labelling lacking a frequency 
in section 4.8, the signal is confirmed and further assessment is warranted. 
1.3.  Proposed recommendation 
The PRAC Rapporteur will perform an in-depth evaluation of the preliminary report which describes a 
meta-analysis of data from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, including the need for updates on 
e.g. the product information for these respective vaccines, as appropriate. 
In parallel the MAH will be requested to discuss these new findings, including the need to amend the 
current labelling. 
1.4.  Adopted (first) PRAC recommendation 
Having considered that new data on the known risk of myocarditis, pericarditis has become available 
from a preliminary report which describes a meta-analysis of data from Denmark, Finland, Norway and 
Sweden, the PRAC has recommended the following. 
1.  The PRAC Rapporteur for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Comirnaty should perform an in-depth 
evaluation of the preliminary report and compile a List of Questions for the researchers and the 
MAH for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Comirnaty (BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH), as 
appropriate. Considering that the results of the study are expected to become available 
starting with 25 October 2021 at the earliest, these Lists of Questions will be further discussed 
in the PRAC plenary 25-28 October. 
2.  The MAH for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Comirnaty (BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH) should 
continuously monitor the emerging evidence on the association between COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccine Comirnaty and myocarditis and pericarditis arising from all available of sources (e.g. 
clinical studies, observational studies considering in various jurisdictions, company data bases). 
5 
 
 
 
 
3.  The Agency will provide an updated expected to observed analysis considering the most recent 
EudraVigilance data and EEA exposure to COVID-19 vaccines including in the under 18 years 
old. 
2.  Additional  evidence  (second  round  of  signal  assessment 
procedure) 
The assessment of additional data in the second round of this procedure (i.e. the assessment of the 
preliminary results dated 5th October 2021 of a study entitled SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and risk of 
pericarditis and myocarditis: Nordic nationwide cohort study of 20 million individuals) has been 
relocated to the Annex of this AR, since these preliminary results are superseded by a manuscript, 
supplemental information, tables and figures, on the final results from the Nordic meta-analysis of 
SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination and Myocarditis among 23 million residents, as circulated by MPA on 5 
November 2021. These final results are assessed in section 3.1. below. 
2.1.  Adopted (second) PRAC recommendation 
Considering the current EU product labelling for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the new data on the 
risk of myocarditis and pericarditis that have become available after the PRAC recommendation in July 
2021, the PRAC has agreed that the MAH of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Comirnaty (BioNTech 
Manufacturing GmbH) should provide by 15 November 2021 a review of the respective data from 
clinical studies, from the scientific literature and other data available in public domain (e.g. published 
data from Canada, Israel, US and other jurisdictions). The MAH should respond to the below List of 
Questions separately for myocarditis and pericarditis.  
List of Questions: 
1. The MAH should provide a risk estimation of myocarditis and pericarditis overall and per age groups 
(e.g. 5-11, 12-15, 16-17, 18-24, 25-29, 30-39, 40+ also depending  on  age groups used  in studies), 
gender, vaccine dose(s) (i.e. first, second or booster).  
2. The MAH should perform further characterisation of myocarditis and pericarditis, with focus on the 
following: 
• 
Provide an estimation of the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis, with the view to 
better characterize the current ‘unknown’ frequency in the product labelling. 
• 
Discuss any plausible pathophysiological mechanism(s) of myocarditis and pericarditis 
observed after COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Comirnaty.  
• 
Data  on  the  characteristics,  severity,  duration  and  outcome  of  myocarditis  and 
pericarditis after vaccination with Covid-19 mRNA vaccine Comirnaty.

3.  Additional  evidence  (third  round  of  signal  assessment 
procedure) 
3.1.  Assessment of additional data submitted by the MAH 
On 15 November 2021 the MAH submitted their response to the PRAC Assessment Report Signal 
Assessment Report on Myocarditis, pericarditis dated 29 October 2021, which is reviewed below. 
PRAC’s recommendations and questions in bold italics are followed by the MAH’s responses in plain 
text. 
2. QUERIES 
Considering the current EU product labelling for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the new data 
on the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis that have become available after the PRAC 
recommendation in July 2021, the PRAC has agreed that the MAH of COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccine Comirnaty (BioNTech manufacturing GmbH) should provide by 15 November 2021 a 
review of the respective data from clinical studies, from the scientific literature and other 
literature in the public domain (e.g. published data from Canada, Israel, US and other 
jurisdictions). The MAH should respond to the below List of Questions separately for 
myocarditis and pericarditis. 
List of Questions: 
Question 1 
The MAH should provide a risk estimation of myocarditis and pericarditis overall and per age 
groups (e.g. 5-11, 12-15, 16-17, 18-24, 25-29, 30-39, 40+ also depending on age groups 
used in studies), gender, vaccine dose(s) (i.e. first, second or booster). 
Question 2 
The MAH should perform further characterization of myocarditis and pericarditis, with focus 
on the following: 
•  Provide an estimation of the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis, with the view 
to better characterize the current ‘unknown’ frequency in the product labelling. 
•  Discuss any plausible pathophysiological mechanism(s) of myocarditis and 
pericarditis observed after COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Comirnaty. 
•  Data on the characteristics, severity, duration and outcome of myocarditis and 
pericarditis after vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Comirnaty. 
Summary of MAH RESPONSE 
In response to the PRAC request dated 29 October 2021, the MAH conducted cumulative reviews of 
relevant clinical epidemiological, non-clinical and post-marketing data in order to determine whether 
there is new or significant information to suggest the risk has changed. 
Clinical Trial Data 
There were 4 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in the pivotal study, C4591001, to the cut-off date 
of 31 August 2021, are presented below: 
7 
 
 
 
1.  The first case was reported in <18-year-old who originally received placebo, and then received 
two (2) doses of BNT162b2 (30μg). This participant developed myocarditis 3 days after the 
second dose of BNT162b2 (30μg), which resolved 2 days later; was considered a serious 
adverse event by the investigator but was not considered related to vaccine. 
2.  The second case was reported in a 20-29-year-old who was randomized to received placebo, 
and developed myocarditis with right retroatrial inflammation 6 days after the second dose of 
placebo, which resolved 1 day later. It was mild in severity and was not considered related to 
vaccine by the investigator. 
3.  The third case was reported in a 50-59-year-old participant who originally received placebo 
and then received two (2) doses of BNT162b2 (30μg). This participant developed pericarditis 
152 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 (30μg) and was still ongoing at the time of the 
data cutoff date. This was reported as a serious adverse event by the investigator but 
considered not related to vaccine. 
4.  The fourth case was reported in a 60-69-year-old participant randomized to receive BNT162b2 
(30μg). This participant developed pericarditis 29 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 
(30μg), which resolved 217 days later. This event was considered serious by the investigator 
but was not considered related to vaccine. 
No incidence was calculated due to the crossover nature of the study. Up to 31 August 2021, a total 
of 44,699 subjects received at least one dose of BNT162B2 in this trial. 
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
Of the 4 cases reported in the pivotal clinical trial, two of the cases were reported in subjects who 
originally received placebo, but developed myocarditis/pericarditis after receiving two doses of 
Comirnaty (crossover), and the third case were reported in a subject randomized to receive Comirnaty.  
Therefore, the number of cases of myocarditis/pericarditis reported from clinical trials is 3 in the active 
group and 1 in the placebo group. 
It is agreed that based on these 4 cases exclusively no causal relation with the vaccine or accurate 
ADR incidence can be concluded. Nevertheless, the PRAC Rap notes that the current frequency 
category in 4.8 (frequency unknown) does not adequately represent the currently increasing body of 
evidence gathered in the post-marketing phase based on evidence from observational studies. 
See comments below. 
Epidemiological Data 
Observed Versus Expected Analyses 
Please refer to Appendix 5.1 Observed versus Expected Analyses for Adverse Events of Special Interest 
of the SMSR 11 for updated analyses of myocarditis and myocarditis/pericarditis by age, gender, and 
vaccine dose for the EEA and US using a range of background incidence rate estimates. The age-
groups provided for the O/E in the SMSR for myocarditis and myocarditis/pericarditis were selected 
based on the availability of reported vaccine administration information and background rates from 
ACCESS. The relevant O/E analyses were included as Annex, but are summarized here. 
Comment PRAC Rap:

The O/E analyses for myocarditis in European Economic Area (EEA, Table 1), US (Table 2) using a 14-
day risk window are shown below. The O/E ratios for 21-day risk window were slightly lower (not 
reproduced here). 
Table 3 shows the O/E Analysis of Myocarditis/Pericarditis combined in EEA Countries. The O/E ratios 
for US were roughly 3-fold lower (not reproduced here).

Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
The MAH provided an updated O/E analyses stratified by age, and gender, for EEA and US separately, for Myocarditis only and Myocarditis/Pericarditis 
combined, using 14- and 21-day risk windows, and low-/mid- and high background incidence rates. 
Generally, the results are consistent with previous findings, with the difference that the number of cases and vaccine exposure in the younger age groups 
have increased, leading to somewhat more precision in the estimates. 
Based on the O/E analyses presented above (Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3) it is noted that although the absolute number of cases in males is higher, the 
background incidence in males is also higher. Consequently, the O/E ratios above 1 do not really differ that much between males and females. This aspect is 
currently not reflected in the current wording in SmPC section 4.4. On the other hand, the numbers of female cases shown here, but also in the 
epidemiological studies cited by the MAH (as well as those conducted by VAC4EU and EPI-PHARE) are low, especially in the younger females, which raises 
the question regarding robustness of these estimates. The MAH should commit to remain closely evaluating the risk estimates in females, and in case more 
(robust, stable) data would become available, provide a proposal for refined/adjusted the wording in Section 4.4, as appropriate.

Incidence of Myocarditis and Pericarditis  
The MAH has conducted literature reviews of myocarditis and pericarditis risk after BNT162b2 
vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection, as summarized below. Overall, risk varied widely depending on 
the study methodology, definition of study population, length of follow-up period, and definitions of 
myocarditis and pericarditis used. Studies consistently reported higher risk after Dose 2 and among 
younger males (<30 years) post-vaccination, as well as higher risk after COVID-19 infections when 
compared with reported rates for individuals without COVID-19 infection or after vaccination.  
Studies from Israel, US, and Australia reported the incidence of myocarditis following BNT162b2 
vaccination for all ages combined. A real-world study using integrated health care data in Israel 
included 884,828 persons who received BNT162b2 vaccine and estimated the risk of 
myocarditis/pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination compared with unvaccinated persons.v 
Vaccination was associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis (risk ratio [RR], 3.24; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.55 to 12.44; excess risk [ER], 27 events per million persons; 95% CI, 10 to 46). SARS-
CoV-2 infection was also associated with an increased risk of myocarditis (RR, 18.28; 95% CI, 3.95 to 
25.12; ER, 110 events per million persons; 95% CI, 56 to 158). Vaccination non-significantly increased 
the risk of pericarditis as well (RR 1.27; 95% CI, 0.68 to 2.31; ER, 10 events per million persons; 95% 
CI, -16 to 34). SARS CoV-2 infection posed higher and significant risk of pericarditis (RR, 5.39; 95% 
CI, 2.22 to 23.58; ER, 109 events per million persons; 95% CI, 49 to 169).  
The Vaccine Safety Datalink,vi which includes 8 data-contributing US health plans comprising 
12,506,658 people of all ages and representing 3.6% of the US population, reported the incidence of 
myocarditis/pericarditis treated in ED or hospital settings within 21 days post vaccination and 
compared it to 22 to 42 days after either dose 1 or 2. The rate of events post-vaccination (any dose) 
was 131.7/million person-years compared with 106.9/million person-years in the comparison interval 
(adjusted rate ratio 1.18 [95% CI 0.79-1.79]). The dose-specific myocarditis/pericarditis rates among 
individuals 12-39 years were 70.4/million person-years post-dose 1 (vs. 35.0/million in comparison 
interval) and 221.3/million post-dose 2 (vs. 44.6/million in comparison interval).vi 
Two additional studies reported myocarditis and pericarditis frequency following BNT162b2 vaccination 
for all ages combined of 10 (95% CI 6.1-15.4) per million for myocarditis and 18 (95% CI 13.-25.5) 
per million for pericarditis in a US healthcare system,vii and 13.5 cases of myocarditis and/or 
pericarditis per million doses in Australia.viii 
Studies from Israel and surveillance data in the United States have provided age- and dose-specific 
estimates. One study from Israel,ix conducted as part of ongoing national surveillance and without 
involvement from the Sponsor, evaluated the relative risk of post-vaccination myocarditis with respect 
to comparator populations. This retrospective analysis of medically reviewed cases of myocarditis 
identified through passive and active surveillance for the period 20 December 2020 through 31 May 
2021 found an overall standardized incidence ratio of 5.34 after a second dose using a 30-day risk 
window compared to 2017-2019 rates, driven mostly by the standardized incidence rate (SIR) in males 
under 30 years of age (Table 4). Elevated SIRs were not observed after Dose 1 in any age/sex 
category (95% CI included 1). The highest absolute risk was observed after the second dose among 
male recipients between the ages of 16 and 19 years: 150.7 per million persons. In males after the 
second dose, the incidence of myocarditis decreased with age: estimated at 109 per million for those 
between the ages of 20-24 years, 70 for those 25-29 years, 37 for those 30-39 years of age, 12 for 
those 40-49 years, and 2 for those 50 years or older. Among females the incidence after the second 
dose was 10 per million for those 16-19 years, 22 per million for those 20-24 years, 0 (no case 
reported) for those 25-29 years, 2 for those 30-39 years of age, 5 for those 40-49 years, and 2 for 
those 50 years or older. This study did not include information about vaccinees 12 to 15 years of age.

Another studyx searched the database of Clalit Health Services, the largest health care organization in 
Israel, for diagnoses of myocarditis in patients who had received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 
mRNA vaccine. The estimated incidence per million persons who had received at least one dose of 
vaccine was 21.3 cases (95% CI, 15.6-27.0). The highest incidence of myocarditis (106.9 per million; 
95% CI, 69.3-144.6) was reported in male patients between the ages of 16 and 29 years and in those 
aged 30 years or older (21.1 per million, 95% CI 11.9–30.4). The incidence in females was 
substantially lower, 3.4 (95% CI 0–10) per million among younger female adults aged 16-29 years and 
2.0 (95% CI 0–4.8) per million in those aged 30 years or older.x 
Information about myocarditis and perimyocarditis by age has been reported by the Israeli Ministry of 
Health as part of their overall COVID-19 Vaccine monitoring (Figure 1). xi Among males the reporting 
rate of myocarditis was lower for individuals 12 to 15 years of age than for individuals 16 to 19 years 
of age for both dose 1 (1/196,398=0.51 vs 3/261,112=1.15 per 100,000 doses) and dose 2 
(11/158,541=6.94 vs 37/226,452=16.34 per 100,000 doses), with rates for both doses declining 
thereafter with age. Among females the rate was lowest for individuals 30+ years of age for dose 2 
(8/2,045,584= 0.39 per 100,000 doses) and highest for those 20-24 years of age 
(6/246,129=2.44/100,000 doses). Compared to dose 2, risk does not appear higher after dose 3 for 
either males or females (Males; age 12-15: 0 cases; age 16-19: 6/108,504=5.53 cases/100,000 
doses; age 20-24: 6/155,935=3.85/100,000 doses; age 25-29: 1/148,410=0.67/100,000 doses; age

2/1,599,973=0.13/100,000 doses).

Figure 1.  Myocarditis and perimyocarditis cases reported to the Israel Ministry of Health 
following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination 
Source:xi 
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has information on the number of myocarditis 
cases within 7 days of vaccination per million second doses from spontaneous reports in the US. A 
similar pattern was observed as in Israel 30 days post second dose, although rates were lower due in 
part to the length of the risk window.xii,xiii  Among males aged 12-29 years, myocarditis reporting rates 
were 40.6 per million second doses of mRNA vaccines administered; the reporting rate was 2.4 per 
million second doses for males aged >=30 years.xiii The reporting rate among females was 4.2 per 
million second doses for 12-29 years and 1.0 per million for >=30 years. Myocarditis rates were higher 
after dose 2, and among 16-17 year olds for both males (69.1/million second doses) (Figure 2) and 
females (7.9/million second doses) (Figure 3).

Reported rates of myocarditis are higher after SARS-CoV-2 infection than rates reported after 
vaccination. In one hospital-based study, individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis had 7-37 times the 
risk of myocarditis compared to those without COVID-19xiv depending on age-group, with risk ranging 
from 77/100,000 in individuals 25-39 years to 238/100,000 among 75+ years; the risk was 
133/100,000 among individuals under 16 years of age.xiv A study of United  Statesxv medical claims 
that included 70,288 COVID-19 patients (53% hospitalized, 5% ICU) reported the incidence of acute 
myocarditis overall was 100/100,000 within 30 days after the index diagnosis.xv 
It is important to note that data described above reflect rates from different regions, source data (e.g. 
spontaneous reports, registries, administrative), and using different methodologies. This could explain, 
at least partially, the variability in the reported rates between studies. Therefore, an integrated or side-
by-side analysis is not appropriate, and it is not possible to use the available data to provide a single 
estimate of risk. Overall, in aggregate, the studies reported higher risk after dose 2 compared to dose 
1, and among younger males compared to older males or females of any age post-vaccination. Risk 
was lower for individuals 12-15 years, higher for 16-19 years, and generally declining thereafter with 
age. Reported risk for myocarditis after COVID-19 infections was higher when compared with reported 
rates for individuals without COVID-19 infection or after vaccination. The MAH will continue to monitor 
the literature and safety data for myocarditis and pericarditis by age, sex, and dose. 
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
The MAH has conducted literature reviews of myocarditis and pericarditis risk after BNT162b2 
vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection, as summarized above. 
Overall, risk varied depending on the study methodology, definition of study population, length of 
follow-up period, and definitions of myocarditis and pericarditis used. 
Observational studies consistently reported higher risk after Dose 2 and among younger males 
(<30 years) post-vaccination, as well as higher risk after COVID-19 infections when compared with 
reported rates for individuals without COVID-19 infection or after vaccination. 
In addition to the literature cited by the MAH, the Rapporteur has recently been notified of two 
further studies by the EMA/VAC4EU (retrospective, multi-database, cohort study) and EPI-PHARE 
Signal assessment report on Myocarditis, pericarditis with Tozinameran (COVID-19 
mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified) – COMIRNATY)

- Scientific Interest Group (GIS) ANSM-CNAM (matched case-control study in the FR national health 
data system (SNDS)), which are briefly summarised below in Sections 3.5 and 3.6 of this AR.  
The MAH noted that the data described above reflect rates from different regions, source data (e.g. 
spontaneous reports, registries, administrative), and using different methodologies, which could 
explain, at least partially, the variability in the reported rates between studies. Hence it is recognized 
that an integrated or side-by-side analysis is not appropriate. 
Nevertheless, although challenging, the available data from the increasing number of published 
observational studies, all point in the same direction and can be used to provide a better estimate of 
risk, i.e. as currently described with ADR frequency ‘unknown’ in the product information. 
For instance based on the studies cited by the MAH: 
• 
Two studies reported myocarditis and pericarditis frequency following BNT162b2 vaccination for 
all ages combined of 10 (95% CI 6.1-15.4) per million for myocarditis and 18 (95% CI 
13.-25.5) per million for pericarditis in a US healthcare system,xvi and 13.5 cases of myocarditis 
and/or pericarditis per million doses in Australia.xvii 
• 
Information about myocarditis and perimyocarditis by age has been reported by the Israeli 
Ministry of Health as part of their overall COVID-19 Vaccine monitoring (Figure 1). xviii Among 
males the reporting rate of myocarditis was lower for individuals 12 to 15 years of age than for 
individuals 16 to 19 years of age for both dose 1 (1/196,398=0.51 vs 3/261,112=1.15 per 
100,000 doses) and dose 2 (11/158,541=6.94 vs 37/226,452=16.34 per 100,000 doses), 
with rates for both doses declining thereafter with age. 
Based on the currently available body of evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing observational 
studies the incidence of myocarditis ranged from 0.1-1.6 per 10,000, hence a frequency category 
Very Rare < 1 per 10,000 in the SmPC section 4.8 would be more appropriate. The rationale for the 
frequency category could be explained in sub-section c “Description of selected adverse reactions”. I.e. 
a footnote could be considered noting that the incidence of myocarditis in the younger males was at 
the high end of the range and would be closer to frequency category rare (≥1/10.000, <1/1.000) 
In addition, the current wording should be further refined. The current product information section 4.4 
mentions: Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed following vaccination 
with Comirnaty. These cases have primarily occurred within 14 days following vaccination, more often 
after the second vaccination, and more often in younger men. 
It is proposed to remove and replace ‘men’ (which implies adults only) by ‘males’, as also cases have 
been observed in adolescent males aged below 18 years. 
Nonclinical Data 
An established mechanism for myocarditis or pericarditis has not been determined. Pfizer continues to 
monitor data from clinical trials, information gathered from pharmacovigilance databases, and 
literature for information that would potentially inform on a plausible mechanism. 
Assessment of plausible pathophysiological mechanisms for the relationship between the COVID-19 
mRNA vaccine and myocarditis or pericarditis has included database searches (such as Pharmapendium 
and OFF-X), epitope mimicry assessments, and literature reviews. Although there are rare reports of 
vaccine-associated myocarditis (eg, influenza vaccines) and extensive reporting on smallpox vaccine-
associated myocarditis, no pathophysiological cause has been identified. Underlying genetic

mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified) – COMIRNATY)

predisposition to myocarditis may contribute to post-vaccination-associated myocarditis, but there is 
little in the published literature to support such a conclusion at this time.  
Direct toxicities generally manifest consistently in clinical trials. Therefore, a direct effect of the mRNA 
vaccine or the expressed spike protein on the heart would have been expected to occur more 
frequently and been identified in clinical trials; as such, this mechanism is considered less likely. The 
nonclinical safety assessment of BNT162 vaccine candidates included 2 GLP repeat dose toxicity 
studies and a GLP developmental and reproductive toxicity study. There were no effects on the heart in 
any of these studies. Further, distribution of vaccine to the heart was not identified in rats 
administered an IM dose of a modRNA-LNP encoding luciferase (as a surrogate protein). Circulating 
levels of spike protein post-vaccination have not been well studied. The expressed spike protein 
antigen is anticipated to remain membrane bound or presented in association with MHC and would 
likely have limited systemic distribution. One report investigated circulating levels of spike protein after 
vaccination with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 vaccine), but levels were shown to be very low after 
the first vaccination and undetectable after the second vaccination.xix Biodistribution studies using a 
modRNA-LNP encoding luciferase (surrogate protein) identified luciferase expression only in the region 
of the IM administration and in the liver. Liver luciferase expression is consistent with LNP distribution 
and most likely reflects local mRNA expression of the protein and not distribution of luciferase from 
systemic exposure of secreted luciferase. Therefore, systemic exposure of Spike protein with binding to 
ACE2 in any tissues, potentially initiating off-target immune responses, would be not be expected. 
Further, ACE2 expression is low in the heart relative to other tissues.xx There is limited reporting that 
ACE2 may be upregulated in the heart after COVID-19 infection (see below and Chen et al, 2020xxi). 
Data suggests that patients exhibiting clinical signs of myocarditis or pericarditis after vaccination are 
not SARS-CoV-2 infected based on a negative qPCR test.  
Indirect mechanisms (i.e., immune-related) and non-vaccine associated (e.g., microbial, toxic, etc.) 
mechanisms have also been assessed as potential causes for reported post-COVID mRNA vaccine 
myocarditis. Immune-mediated mechanisms include hypersensitivity myocarditis, autoimmune 
myocarditis, and immune-associated exacerbation of subclinical/asymptomatic myocarditis. 
Hypersensitivity myocarditis is generally characterized by circulating eosinophilia and eosinophil 
infiltrates in endomyocardial biopsies. Some reports in the literature have demonstrated eosinophils 
within the endomyocardial biopsies from patients who developed myocarditis after vaccination. 
However, most reports and cases examined by Pfizer are not associated with either peripheral 
eosinophilia or eosinophilic infiltrates in endomyocardial biopsies from affected patients. Myocarditis 
and pericarditis have been associated with auto-immune diseases such as Lupusxxii, although these 
diseases tend to occur more frequently in females compared with males.xxiii Vaccines have been 
associated with transient autoimmune disorders such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. However, the data 
suggest that myocarditis reported after COVID-19 mRNA vaccine administration is unlikely to be the 
result of autoimmunity. This is based on the predominantly mild and transient nature of the 
myocarditis clinically and the lack significant lymphocytic infiltrates or presence of immune complexes 
(by immunohistochemistry) in endomyocardial biopsies.ix Although the microscopic findings in 
endomyocardial biopsies were not suggestive of a cellular immune response, the potential risk for 
molecular mimicry as a cause for myocarditis/pericarditis was evaluated internally. Peptide sequences 
from the spike protein antigen of Comirnaty were compared against human peptides by homology 
search. There were no matches against human peptides to the spike peptides of greater than or equal 
to 9 mers. Matches for smaller peptides were similar to what has been reported previously.xxiv 
However, these matches would not explain the predominance of younger males associated with 
myocarditis. Exacerbation of subclinical/asymptomatic myocarditis related to COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccination innate immune activation is a possible explanation which is consistent with both the sex

and age groups affected, as well as the transient nature of the finding clinically. However, there are no 
data internally or within the literature to support this hypothesis.   
In published reports evaluated by Pfizer, viral serology for other main cardiotropic viruses were 
negative in patients exhibiting clinical signs of myocarditis or pericarditis.  
In performing a comprehensive evaluation of potential mechanisms for myocarditis or pericarditis, to 
date, Pfizer has uncovered nothing of substance from the nonclinical perspective to identify a potential 
root cause of myocarditis or pericarditis as to consider it an established mechanism. Further, animal 
models of myocarditis or pericarditis are not well established and therefore would not serve as a viable 
model to perform additional nonclinical assessments. 
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
The MAH’s evaluation discussion of potential pathophysiological mechanisms is accepted. 
At the moment no clear mechanism can be established based on the available evidence. The following 
aspects were highlighted: 
• 
Although there are rare reports of vaccine-associated myocarditis (e.g. influenza vaccines) and 
extensive reporting on smallpox vaccine-associated myocarditis, no pathophysiological cause has 
been identified. Underlying genetic predisposition to myocarditis may contribute to post-
vaccination-associated myocarditis, but there is little in the published literature to support such a 
conclusion at this time. 
• 
Four cases in the pivotal clinical (2 in placebo and 2 in vaccine arm; none of which were vaccine-
related by investigator) did not indicate direct toxicity (i.e. a direct effect of the mRNA vaccine or 
the expressed spike protein on the heart). 
• 
• 
• 
• 
No effects on the heart in any of the preclinical study program were observed (including 2 GLP 
repeat dose toxicity studies and a GLP developmental and reproductive toxicity study). 
Biodistribution studies using a modRNA-LNP encoding luciferase (surrogate protein) identified 
luciferase expression only in the region of the IM administration and in the liver. Liver luciferase 
expression is consistent with LNP distribution and most likely reflects local mRNA expression of 
the protein and not distribution of luciferase from systemic exposure of secreted luciferase. 
Systemic exposure of Spike protein with binding to ACE2 in any tissues, potentially initiating off-
target immune responses, would not be expected. 
ACE2 expression is lower in the heart relative to other tissues 
The potential risk for molecular mimicry as a cause for myocarditis/pericarditis was evaluated by 
the MAH internally. Peptide sequences from the spike protein antigen of Comirnaty were 
compared against human peptides by homology search. There were no matches against human 
peptides to the spike peptides of greater than or equal to 9 mers. Matches for smaller peptides 
were similar to what has been reported previously.xxv However, these matches would not explain 
the predominance of younger males associated with myocarditis. Exacerbation of 
subclinical/asymptomatic myocarditis related to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination innate immune 
activation is a possible explanation which is consistent with both the sex and age groups 
affected, as well as the transient nature of the finding clinically. 
• 
In published reports evaluated by MAH, viral serology for other main cardiotropic viruses were 
negative in patients exhibiting clinical signs of myocarditis or pericarditis. Consequently, a causal 
role of the vaccine is an at least reasonable possibility, in absence of these alternative etiologies.

Within the context of routine pharmacovigilance the MAH should continue to scrutinise any relevant 
safety findings and published scientific literature regarding the pathophysiological mechanism. 
Post-marketing Data 
Estimated Exposure and Use Patterns 
Approximately 1,958,966,949 doses of BNT162b2 were shipped worldwide from the receipt of the first 
temporary authorisation for emergency supply on 01 December 2020 through 28 October 2021, 
corresponding to approximately 1,584,774,361 estimated administered doses. In the EU-EEA region, 
approximately 541,004,490 doses of BNT162b2 were shipped in the EU-EEA countries from the receipt 
of the first conditional marketing authorisation approval on 21 December 2020 through 28 October 
2021, corresponding to 427,393,547 estimated administered doses. The top 3 EU-EEA countries by the 
cumulative number of administered doses are Germany, France and Italy. 
Detailed methodology and analysis of exposure data, including analyses by geographic region, dose 
number and patient age group is provided in the Summary Monthly Safety Reports (SMSR). 
Overview of Cumulative Post-Marketing Safety Database 
As of 28 October 2021, there was a total of 564,284 cumulative reports received from post-marketing 
data sources for PF-07302048 (BNT162b2), as per the methodology described in the SMSR1. This 
dataset was used to retrieve cases potentially indicative of myocarditis and pericarditis, as described 
below. 
Cumulative Post-Marketing Safety Database Review of Myocarditis and Pericarditis  
As “myocarditis and pericarditis” is a safety concern for BNT162b2, analysis of new information 
collected from the post-marketing data sources is provided in the monthly SMSRs, Section 9.5. The 
SMSR evaluation provides detailed information on the interval potentially relevant cases2, with 
separate discussion provided for myocarditis and pericarditis cases, as well as sub-group analyses by 
age, medical confirmation, and Brighton Collaboration Level assessment.  
For the purpose of this response, the MAH conducted a cumulative analysis of myocarditis and 
pericarditis covering up to and including 28 October 2021(as of 29 October 2021), including separate 
summaries by condition (myocarditis, pericarditis), age group and gender using the same search 
criteria as the SMSR.  
The cumulative descriptive analysis of post-marketing cases of myocarditis and pericarditis, by age 
strata and gender is provided in ANNEX 2 to this AR (not all tables are reproduced here).

workflow cycle in the safety database (meaning that they went to Distribution or Closed workflow status at least once) have 
been included. This approach will prevent the inclusion of cases initially received and not fully processed since cases in early 
steps of the workflow process may still undergo changes and not accurately reflect final data.

b. In order to provide a more specific analysis the MAH, starting with cases reported on 1 October 2021 forward, 
limited the BC criteria classification to cases of myocarditis and pericarditis that are both medically confirmed and 
having a time to onset ≤ 21 days. BC assessment of Pericarditis has been conducted only for cases reported starting 
15 July 2021, the date of publishing of BC criteria for Pericarditis. Prior to that date cases were assessed based on 
acute and chronic classification.

In order to retrieve the most relevant data on the characteristics, severity, duration and outcome of 
myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with BNT162b2, as per the PRAC request, the MAH has 
conducted a tailored and detailed review of the myocarditis and pericarditis medically confirmed cases 
assessed as Brighton Collaboration Level 1,xxvi as these cases provide the highest level of diagnostic 
confirmation. However, the BC classification does not account for aspects which would inform on the 
causal association with the vaccine administration, such as time to onset, patient medical history and 
alternative aetiologies, and these were therefore reviewed separately. 
BC level 1 - Myocarditis 
Brighton Collaboration (BC) assessment of cases is shown in Table 6. Of the total 4106 reported cases 
of Myocarditis, there were 334 cases (8.1% of myocarditis dataset, 0.06% of the cumulative dataset) 
assessed as BC level 1, where the case narratives reflected either a positive biopsy or positive findings 
on a cardiac MRI or an Echocardiogram associated with elevated Troponin pointing to a confirmed 
Myocarditis.  The majority of this confirmed Myocarditis cluster of cases involved males (268) in 
addition to 65 females and 1 case of unreported gender.  
The age of the patients ranged from 12-85 years old (MN:31.7). Additionally, these cases reflected a 
time-to-onset (TTO) (less than 21 days)- and a dose sequence (post second dose Comirnaty received)-
dependent pattern of event occurrence. Specifically, 176 cases occurred after the second injection 
while 97 cases occurred after the first. There were 209 cases occurring on or before 21 days post 
vaccination while 18 cases occurred between 22 to 30 days, 17 between 31 to 100 days, and the rest 
of an unknown latency.

France was the most frequently reporting country (129) in this BC level 1 cluster of cases followed by 
Germany (45), Spain (33) and the US (21).  The most common age segment of patients in this cluster 
was 18-24 years of age (92) cases. Nineteen of the BC level 1 cases had history of COVID-19 infection, 
14 had history of Myocarditis and 2 cases had history of Pericarditis.  
All of the cases were assessed as serious adverse events. The most common cause of seriousness was 
hospitalization. There were five cases with fatal outcome 3 males and 1 female majority from Japan 
(3), 1 from Israel and 1 from Sweden ranging in age between 50 to 85 years of age (MN:72.4). All BC 
level 1 cases with fatal outcome reported a medical history, which included DM, prostatic hyperplasia, 
plasma cell myeloma, thyroid neoplasm, dyslipidaemia, cerebral infarction and oesophageal oedema. 
No autopsy has been performed for any of these cases to confirm that Myocarditis was the cause of 
death. Only one of the cases with fatal outcome had a positive COVID-19 test result or was exposed to 
COVID-19 infection prior to vaccine administration.

Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
Generally, the updated (covering up to and including 28 Oct 2021) cumulative review of BC level 1 
Myocarditis did not identify new safety findings: 
The majority of cases were males (268) in addition to 65 females and 1 case of unreported gender. 
The age of the patients ranged from 12-85 years old (mean:31.7). More cases (n=176) occurred after 
the 2nd injection, while 97 cases occurred after the first. There were 209 cases occurring on or before 
21 days post vaccination while 18 cases occurred between 22 to 30 days, 17 between 31 to 100 days, 
and the rest of an unknown latency. 
The most common cause of seriousness was hospitalization. There were five cases with fatal outcome 
3 males and 1 female majority from Japan (3), 1 from Israel and 1 from Sweden ranging in age 
between 50 to 85 years of age. All BC level 1 cases with fatal outcome reported a medical history, 
which included DM, prostatic hyperplasia, plasma cell myeloma, thyroid neoplasm, dyslipidaemia, 
cerebral infarction and oesophageal oedema. 
In addition the MAH also provided an comprehensive cumulative overview of relevant data (i.e. 
characteristics, severity, duration and outcome) of all (not only BC 1) myocarditis cases following 
vaccination with Comirnaty, by age stratum.  
Subjects aged 5-11 years: There was 1 medically confirmed case involving a patient who experienced 
myocarditis, leading to hospitalization 4 days after Dose 2, with an unknown clinical outcome. 
MS1 comment (endorsed by PRAC Rapporteur): 
The MAH provided a cumulative review of relevant data, and included a medically confirmed case of 
myocarditis involving a patient who experienced myocarditis, leading to hospitalization 4 days after 
dose 2, with an unknown clinical outcome. This case is not consistent with earlier observations of 
myocarditis, and in view of the recent approval of Comirnaty for children aged 5 to 11 years, additional 
data on the outcome of this case is expected.

These data on characteristics/demographic, clinical disease course and outcome are consistent with 
earlier observations. Although cases are considered serious due to the required hospitalization, in 
cases <18 years of age the duration of the event (where reported to be resolved) was between 3 to 20 
days (median 4 days). 
However, it is noted that still in a considerable number of cases no information on the duration of 
event, or whether the events were resolved is available. The MAH is expected to keep the clinical 
course, severity, outcome, sequelae under close monitoring in both spontaneous reports and ongoing

and planned observational studies. The Rapporteur should be notified immediately in case of 
unexpected findings or trends. 
A similar picture was observed in the cases above 18 years, with a median duration of event between 
3 to 6 days.  
Based on the above review the current wording in the SmPC section 4.4 regarding disease course is 
still considered adequate  
BC level 1 - Pericarditis 
Brighton Collaboration (BC) assessment of pericarditis reports is shown in Table 9. Of the total 
reported cases of Pericarditis, there were 13 cases (0.4% of the pericarditis dataset, 0.002% of the 
cumulative dataset) assessed as BC level 1.  The majority of this confirmed Pericarditis diagnosis 
cluster of cases were males (11) in addition to 2 females. The age of the patients ranged from 15-93 
years old (MN:44.3).  
Additionally, these cases reflected a TTO (less than 21 days)- and a dose sequence (post second 
vaccination)-dependent pattern of event occurrence. Specifically, 6 cases occurred after the second 
injection while 4 cases occurred after the first, 1 after the booster and 1 without a reported dose 
sequence. There were 12 cases occurring on or before 21 days post vaccination while 1 case had an 
unknown latency.   
France was the most frequently reporting country (6) in this BC level 1 cluster of cases. The most 
common age segment of patients in this cluster was above 40 years of age (7) cases. One of the BC 
level 1 cases had history of COVID-19 infection and 1 case of Pericarditis. All of the cases were 
assessed as serious adverse events. The most common cause of seriousness was hospitalization. None 
of these cases had a fatal outcome.

Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
Generally, the updated (covering up to and including 28 Oct 2021) cumulative review of BC level 1 
pericarditis cases did not identify new safety information: 
Of the total reported cases of Pericarditis, there were 13 cases (0.4% of the pericarditis dataset, 
0.002% of the cumulative dataset) assessed as BC level 1. The majority of this confirmed Pericarditis 
diagnosis cluster of cases were males (11) in addition to 2 females. The age of the patients ranged 
from 15-93 years old (MN:44.3).  
These cases reflected a TTO (less than 21 days)- and a dose sequence (post second vaccination)-
dependent pattern of event occurrence. Specifically, 6 cases occurred after the second injection while 
4 cases occurred after the first, 1 after the booster and 1 without a reported dose sequence. There 
were 12 cases occurring on or before 21 days post vaccination while 1 case had an unknown latency.

The most common age segment of patients in this cluster was above 40 years of age (7) cases. One of 
the BC level 1 cases had history of COVID-19 infection and 1 case of Pericarditis. All of the cases were 
assessed as serious adverse events. The most common cause of seriousness was hospitalization. None 
of these cases had a fatal outcome. 
In addition the MAH also provided an comprehensive cumulative overview of relevant data (i.e. 
characteristics, severity, duration and outcome) of all (not only BC 1) pericarditis cases following 
vaccination with Comirnaty, by age stratum. Only the data for age groups 12-15 years (Table 10) and 
16-17 years (Table 11) are reproduced here. There were no cases of pericarditis in the age group 
5-11 years.

These data on characteristics/demographic, clinical disease course and outcome are consistent with 
earlier observations. Although cases are considered serious due to the required hospitalization, in 
cases <18 years of age the duration of the event (when reported) was between 3 to 43 days (median 
6-19 days). A similar picture was observed in the cases above 18 years, with a median duration of 
event between 7 to 13 days (data not reproduced here). 
As with the myocarditis cases, also still in a considerable number of pericarditis cases no information 
on the duration of event, or whether the events were resolved is available. The MAH is expected to 
keep the clinical course, severity, outcome, sequelae under close monitoring in both spontaneous 
reports and ongoing and planned observational studies. The Rapporteur should be notified immediately 
in case of unexpected findings or trends. 
Based on the above review the current wording in the SmPC section 4.4 regarding disease course is 
still considered adequate.

Myocarditis and Pericarditis (ages 12-15) 
Out of the total 7403 cumulative cases reported for Myocarditis and Pericarditis, there were 224 cases 
reported in subjects aged 12-15 years old reported to Myocarditis and 94 cases reported to Pericarditis 
in this age group. Of the Myocarditis cases 15 were classified as BC level 1, 9 cases as BC level 2, 132 
cases as BC level 4 and 1 case as BC level 5. The majority of this age cluster were males 189 in 
addition to 31 females and the rest with unreported gender. The most common cause of seriousness 
was hospitalization. None of the cases in this age group had a fatal outcome. One had history of 
Myocarditis, 1 with cardiac murmur and 1 with congenital heart disease. The most commonly reporting 
country in this age group was Hong Kong (31 cases). For Pericarditis assessed for BC classification, 1 
case was assessed as BC level 1, 6 cases as BC level 2, and the rest as BC level 4. The overall cases 
were 43 males and 16 females. The most common cause for seriousness was hospitalization. None of 
the cases of Pericarditis in this age group had a fatal outcome. Two cases had a medical history of 
Pericarditis and 1 case of COVID-19 infection. The most commonly reporting country in this age group 
was Hong Kong (17 cases). 
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
See previous comments. 
Summary of Myocarditis and Pericarditis BC level 1 
It is worth noting that the majority of the BC level 1 cases of Myocarditis and Pericarditis during the 
aforementioned reporting period lacked proper accounting of case duration, , outcome, concomitant 
medication and/or investigative measures to exclude alternate aetiologies such as viral infection, 
cardiovascular disorder, all of which precluded proper medical assessment of causality between the 
event occurrence and vaccine administration. The assessment of cases continues to point to a gender 
(male)-, age (higher for 16-19 year olds)-, TTO (less than 21 days)- and dose-dependent (post second 
vaccination) pattern  of occurrence in Myocarditis as listed in the SmPC and the same for Pericarditis 
albeit in a higher age demographic.  
Given this cluster of cases for confirmed Myocarditis and pericarditis constituted the minority of the 
total reported cases throughout the cumulative period (approximatively 5% of myocarditis and 
pericarditis cases, or 0.06% of the cumulative vaccine dataset), this analysis does not result in 
changing the MAH’s position stated in the product label regarding the risk of Myocarditis or Pericarditis. 
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
Also see comments above regarding all (not only BC 1) reported myocarditis and pericarditis cases. 
The MAH’s conclusions regarding BC 1 cases are noted. 
Post-marketing Safety Summary  
Overall, the review of the safety database found that the reporting of myocarditis and pericarditis 
cases increased with expanded vaccination campaign that now approached approximately 2 billion 
doses. However, these cases represent a minority of the overall vaccine post-marketing dataset 
(1.3%).  
A minority of cases (10%) qualify for BC level 1 classification, and thus with a high degree of 
diagnostic accuracy. Even in these cases where myocarditis or pericarditis diagnosis is confirmed, 
causality assessment was not possible for most of these cases due to lack of proper accounting of case

duration, severity, outcome, concomitant medications and/or investigative measures to exclude 
alternate aetiologies such as viral infections, cardiovascular disorders. These limitations of the post-
marketing data are important factors that preclude proper medical assessment of causality between 
the event occurrence and vaccine administration. The assessment of cases continues to point to a 
gender (male)-, age (higher for 16-19 year olds)-, TTO (less than 21 days)- and dose-dependent (post 
second vaccination) pattern of occurrence in Myocarditis as listed in the SmPC and the same for 
Pericarditis albeit a higher age demographic. 
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
The MAH’s general conclusion is endorsed that assessment of cases continues to point to a gender 
(male), age (higher for 16-19 year olds), TTO (less than 21 days) and dose dependent (post second 
vaccination) pattern of occurrence in Myocarditis as listed in the SmPC and the same for Pericarditis 
albeit a higher age demographic. 
The limitations as noted by the MAH are acknowledged. 
Risk Management Strategy 
The EU RMP includes a detailed description of the additional pharmacovigilance activities and their 
milestones to monitor and characterise the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis and a summary is 
presented herein. Studies C4591021(EU), C4591038 (former C4591021 sub-study) (EU), C4591011 
(US), C4591012 (US), and C4591009 (US) will describe the incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis 
following Comirnaty vaccination overall, and stratified by age group, gender, race/ethnicity (if 
feasible), dose, and risk interval using structured information and following case confirmation via 
medical record review where feasible.  To assess the magnitude of risk, these studies include 
comparative methods (self-controlled analyses, and analyses involving a separate comparator group).   
Relative risk (RR) estimates from comparative analyses will be obtained overall and stratified by the 
same factors as described above when supported by sufficient cell counts. 
To evaluate long-term outcomes, myocarditis/pericarditis-specific analytic endpoints in currently 
planned or ongoing studies C4591009, C4591011, C4591012, C4591021 and C4591038 (former 
C4591021 substudy) will assess the natural history of post-vaccination myo-/pericarditis, e.g., 
recovery status (medical record review) and/or identification of serious cardiovascular outcomes 
(structured data) within 1 year of myo-/pericarditis diagnosis among individuals vaccinated with 
COMIRNATY as well as individuals not vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine.  
In addition, a long-term primary data collection study is C4591036 (former Pediatric Heart Network 
(PHN), to evaluate the clinical course, risk factors, long-term sequelae, and quality of life of post-
vaccine myocarditis/pericarditis over a 5-year period. 
Finally, study C4591021 will also estimate the time trend, in relation to DHPC letter dissemination, of 
the proportion of individuals who received real-world clinical assessments for myocarditis/pericarditis 
following Comirnaty vaccination. 
For complete details, please refer to the EU RMP. 
MAH Discussion and Conclusion 
In the large, controlled, pivotal study C4591001, myocarditis and pericarditis cases have been reported 
infrequently, and no imbalance was seen between placebo and active arm for events of myocarditis or 
Signal assessment report on Myocarditis, pericarditis with Tozinameran (COVID-19 
mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified) – COMIRNATY)

pericarditis events. Efforts are ongoing to evaluate the background rate of troponin abnormalities in 
healthy study participants prior to vaccination, to inform whether or not troponin may represent a 
useful biomarker for presence of subclinical myocarditis or pericarditis (if such conditions exist). 
The comprehensive evaluation of potential mechanisms for myocarditis or pericarditis found, to date, 
there is nothing of substance from the nonclinical perspective to identify a potential root cause to 
consider an established mechanism. Further, animal models of myocarditis or pericarditis are not well 
established and therefore do not serve as a viable model to perform additional nonclinical 
assessments. 
In the interpretation of the epidemiology data, it is important to note that data described above reflect 
rates from different regions, different data sources (e.g. spontaneous reports, registries, 
administrative), and using different methodologies. This could explain, at least partially, the variability 
in the reported rates between studies. Therefore, an integrated or side-by-side analysis is not 
appropriate, and it is not possible to use the available data to provide a single estimate of risk. Overall, 
in aggregate, the studies reported higher risk after Dose 2 compared to Dose 1, and among younger 
males compared to older males or females of any age post-vaccination. Risk was lower for individuals 
12-15 years, higher for 16-19 years, and generally declining thereafter with age. Reported risk for 
myocarditis after COVID-19 infections was higher when compared with reported rates for individuals 
without COVID-19 infection or after vaccination.  
The review of the post-marketing cases of myocarditis found that although the number of cases 
increases as the vaccine exposure increases, the profile of cases remains largely unchanged. Within 
this profile, a minority of cases (10%) qualify for BC level 1 classification, and thus provide a high 
degree of diagnostic accuracy. Even in these cases where myocarditis or pericarditis diagnosis is 
confirmed, the review of data to assess causality reveals that cases lack proper accounting of case 
duration, severity, outcome, concomitant medication and/or investigative measures to exclude 
alternate aetiologies such as viral infections or cardiovascular disorders. These limitations of the post-
marketing data are important factors that preclude proper medical assessment of causality between 
the event occurrence and vaccine administration. 
According to the EU SmPC Guidelinexxvii and aligned Pfizer methodology for estimation of ADR 
frequencies, the estimation of the frequency of an adverse reaction depends on the data source, the 
quality of data collection and causality evaluation. Furthermore, the frequency of adverse reactions 
should be derived from pooled placebo-controlled studies if these data are available and the databases 
are sufficiently large to be informative and be represented by crude incidence rates.  Furthermore, the 
guidance clarifies that frequencies based on reporting rates from a spontaneous reporting system 
should not be used to assign frequency category.xxvii  
The EU SmPC provides ADR frequency aligned with the above guidance, with CIOMS ADR frequency 
categories based on the C4591001, as the largest, controlled clinical trial, and most representative of 
the safety profile of the vaccine. However, the use of the C4591001 study results, as per the EU SmPC 
dataset, or the updated analyses described in section 3.2 are not appropriate to support a frequency 
for myocarditis and pericarditis since the case particulars do not support a relationship with the 
vaccination in all cases, and the fact that patients in placebo arm also reported relevant events further 
confounds the assessment of how informative the clinical trial rates are to adequately inform the HCP 
and patient on the magnitude of this risk. Although additional epidemiological data are emerging as 
described in Section 0, it is notable that the results vary by type of study, region, data source 
(spontaneous reporting versus chart review), and thus, no integrated analysis can be produced to 
reliably estimate the frequency of the ADR.

mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified) – COMIRNATY)  
EMA/751066/2021  
Page 32/83 
 
 
 
 
Additionally, several post-marketing studies are ongoing or planned to further characterize this risk 
(see Section 0 and the EU RMP). Until such data become available, the frequency of ‘Not known’ best 
represents the level of knowledge regarding the frequency of this ADR in the individuals receiving 
vaccination with BNT162B2. 
Overall, no new or significant information regarding myocarditis or pericarditis became available. The 
reported data continues to align with the information presented in the EU SmPC. Therefore, no 
changes to the product information or risk management strategy are warranted. Myocarditis and 
pericarditis are important identified risks in the EU RMP and subject to close monitoring and extensive 
pharmacovigilance activities, routine and additional. The positive benefit risk of the BNT162B2 vaccine 
remains unchanged and favourable. 
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
See previous comments regarding ADR frequency and refinement of SmPC section 4.4 wording. 
It is noted that also randomised clinical trials have limitations as is outlined in the SmPC Guidance: 
‘Furthermore, the frequency of adverse reactions should be derived from pooled placebo-controlled 
studies if these data are available and the databases are sufficiently large to be informative 
and be represented by crude incidence rates.’ 
A vaccine exposure of 20,000 subjects in the pivotal RCT may not be sufficient, also considering the 
representation of the population below 18 years-of-age.  
Post-scriptum 
The MAH is grateful for the chance to review the draft manuscript entitled “SARS-CoV-2 vaccination 
and Myocarditis in a Nordic Cohort Study of 23 Million Residents” by Karlstad et al. The above 
conclusions remain unchanged after the review of the article. The data reflecting the risk of Myocarditis 
following the receipt of BNT162b2 vaccine demonstrated in this manuscript are consistent with the 
information already reported in the Comirnaty EU SmPC (i.e. sections 4.4 and 4.8) denoting an age-, 
gender-, dose sequence and latency-dependent pattern of event occurrence occurring most commonly 
in younger males following the second dose within the first 14 days post administration. While it is 
worth noting that key limitations in the manuscript, as recognized by the Authors, are based on event 
detection stemming from hospital admission or discharge primary and secondary codes without access 
to the main reason for hospitalization, cardiac imaging, troponin values or description on hospital 
length of stay, the incidence rate of Myocarditis reflected following vaccination with Comirnaty is not 
higher than the reported data from other studies as described in the Epidemiology section. As per the 
MAH’s post authorization safety analysis, cases of Myocarditis typically tend to respond to standard of 
care, which generally includes precautionary admission to hospital, and with very rare incidence of life-
threatening reaction. Notable in the manuscript is the higher rate of these events in subjects receiving 
doses of different vaccines. Interchange of vaccine products and myocarditis/pericarditis are closely 
monitored by MAH. 
It is the MAH’s conclusion that this manuscript does not provide any new significant information on the 
risk of Myocarditis/pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty as described in the EU SmPC and 
the benefit risk balance of the BNT162b2 vaccine. These events will continue to be monitored and 
analyzed in real time for further evaluation.

The MAH noted the higher rate of these events in subjects receiving doses of different vaccines. 
Interchange of vaccine products and myocarditis/pericarditis are closely monitored by MAH. This is 
endorsed.

3.2.  Discussion on MAH responses 
The MAH provided an updated cumulative review (up to 28 Oct 2021) to in response to the PRAC’s List 
of Questions. 
Overall 
The MAH’s general conclusion is endorsed that assessment of cases continues to point to a gender 
(male), age (higher for 16-19 year olds)-, TTO (less than 21 days)- and dose-dependent (post second 
vaccination) pattern of occurrence in Myocarditis as listed in the SmPC and the same for Pericarditis 
albeit a higher age demographic. 
Myocarditis 
The updated cumulative review of BC level 1 Myocarditis cases did not identify new safety information: 
• 
The majority of cases were males (268) in addition to 65 females and 1 case of unreported 
gender. The age of the patients ranged from 12-85 years old (MN:31.7). More cases (n=176) 
occurred after the 2nd injection, while 97 cases occurred after the first. There were 209 cases 
occurring on or before 21 days post vaccination while 18 cases occurred between 22 to 30 
days, 17 between 31 to 100 days, and the rest of an unknown latency. 
• 
The most common cause of seriousness was hospitalization. There were five cases with fatal 
outcome 3 males and 1 female majority from Japan (3), 1 from Israel and 1 from Sweden 
ranging in age between 50 to 85 years of age. All BC level 1 cases with fatal outcome reported 
a medical history, which included DM, prostatic hyperplasia, plasma cell myeloma, thyroid 
neoplasm, dyslipidaemia, cerebral infarction and oesophageal oedema. 
In addition to evaluation of BC level 1 cases the MAH also provided a comprehensive cumulative 
overview of relevant data (i.e. characteristics, severity, duration and outcome) of all (not only BC 1) 
myocarditis cases following vaccination with Comirnaty by age stratum. Data on 
characteristics/demographic, clinical disease course and outcome are consistent with earlier 
observations. Although cases are considered serious due to the required hospitalization in cases <18 
years of age the duration of the event (when reported) was between 3 to 20 days (median 4 days). A 
similar picture was observed in the cases above 18 years, with a median duration of event between 3 
to 6 days. 
However, it is noted that still in a considerable number of cases no information on the duration of 
event, or whether the events were resolved is available. The MAH is expected to keep the clinical 
course, severity, outcome, sequelae under close monitoring in both spontaneous reports and ongoing 
and planned observational studies. The Rapporteur should be notified immediately in case of 
unexpected findings or trends.

Pericarditis 
The updated cumulative review of BC level 1 pericarditis cases did not identify new safety information: 
•  Of the total reported cases of Pericarditis, there were 13 cases (0.4% of the pericarditis 
dataset, 0.002% of the cumulative dataset) assessed as BC level 1.  The majority of this 
confirmed Pericarditis diagnosis cluster of cases were males (11) in addition to 2 females. The 
age of the patients ranged from 15-93 years old (MN:44.3).  
• 
These cases reflected a TTO (less than 21 days)- and a dose sequence (post second 
vaccination)-dependent pattern of event occurrence. Specifically, 6 cases occurred after the 
second injection while 4 cases occurred after the first, 1 after the booster and 1 without a 
reported dose sequence. There were 12 cases occurring on or before 21 days post vaccination 
while 1 case had an unknown latency. 
• 
The most common age segment of patients in this cluster was above 40 years of age (7) cases. 
One of the BC level 1 cases had history of COVID-19 infection and 1 case of Pericarditis. All of 
the cases were assessed as serious adverse events. The most common cause of seriousness 
was hospitalization. None of these cases had a fatal outcome. 
In addition to evaluation of BC level 1 cases the MAH also provided a comprehensive cumulative 
overview of relevant data (i.e. characteristics, severity, duration and outcome) of all (not only BC 1) 
pericarditis cases following vaccination with Comirnaty, by age stratum. These data are consistent with 
earlier observations. Although cases are considered serious due to the required hospitalization, in 
cases <18 years of age the duration of the event (when reported) was between 3 to 43 days (median 
6-19 days). A similar picture was observed in the cases above 18 years, with a median duration of 
event between 7 to 13 days. 
As with the myocarditis cases, also still in a considerable number of pericarditis cases no information 
on the duration of event, or whether the events were resolved is available. The MAH is expected to 
keep the clinical course, severity, outcome, sequelae under close monitoring in both spontaneous 
reports and ongoing and planned observational studies. The Rapporteur should be notified immediately 
in case of unexpected findings or trends. 
Characteristics, severity, outcome 
Based on the above reviews of characteristics, severity, duration and outcome of myocarditis and 
pericarditis the current wording in the SmPC section 4.4 regarding disease course is still considered 
adequate.  
Pathophysiological mechanism 
At the moment no clear mechanism can be established based on the available evidence. The following 
aspects were highlighted: 
•  Although there are rare reports of vaccine-associated myocarditis (e.g. influenza vaccines) and 
extensive reporting on smallpox vaccine-associated myocarditis, no pathophysiological cause 
has been identified. Underlying genetic predisposition to myocarditis may contribute to post-
vaccination-associated myocarditis, but there is little in the published literature to support such 
a conclusion at this time.

mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified) – COMIRNATY)

• 
Four cases in the pivotal clinical (2 in placebo and 2 in vaccine arm; none of which were 
vaccine-related by investigator) did not indicate direct toxicity (i.e. a direct effect of the mRNA 
vaccine or the expressed spike protein on the heart). 
•  No effects on the heart in any of the preclinical study program were observed (including 2 GLP 
repeat dose toxicity studies and a GLP developmental and reproductive toxicity study). 
•  Biodistribution studies using a modRNA-LNP encoding luciferase (surrogate protein) identified 
luciferase expression only in the region of the IM administration and in the liver. Liver 
luciferase expression is consistent with LNP distribution and most likely reflects local mRNA 
expression of the protein and not distribution of luciferase from systemic exposure of secreted 
luciferase. Systemic exposure of Spike protein with binding to ACE2 in any tissues, potentially 
initiating off-target immune responses, would be not be expected. 
•  ACE2 expression is lower in the heart relative to other tissues 
• 
The potential risk for molecular mimicry as a cause for myocarditis/pericarditis was evaluated 
by the MAH internally. Peptide sequences from the spike protein antigen of Comirnaty were 
compared against human peptides by homology search. There were no matches against human 
peptides to the spike peptides of greater than or equal to 9 mers. Matches for smaller peptides 
were similar to what has been reported previously.xxviii However, these matches would not 
explain the predominance of younger males associated with myocarditis. Exacerbation of 
subclinical/asymptomatic myocarditis related to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination innate immune 
activation is a possible explanation which is consistent with both the sex and age groups 
affected, as well as the transient nature of the finding clinically. 
• 
In published reports evaluated by MAH, viral serology for other main cardiotropic viruses were 
negative in patients exhibiting clinical signs of myocarditis or pericarditis. Consequently, a 
causal role of the vaccine is an at least reasonable possibility, in absence of these alternative 
etiologies. 
Within the context of routine Pharmacovigilance the MAH should continue to scrutinise any relevant 
safety findings and published scientific literature regarding the pathophysiological mechanism. 
Regarding ADR frequency in SmPC section 4.8 
The PRAC Rapporteur considers that the frequency assignment unknown is not accepted. 
The PRAC Rap notes that the current frequency category in 4.8 (frequency unknown) does not 
adequately represent the current body of evidence gathered in the post-marketing phase based on 
observational studies. 
The difficulty in accurately estimating ADR frequencies from post-marketing sources is acknowledged 
(e.g. due to absence of accurate denominator data, potential underestimation of actual cases). 
However the MAH’s proposal of Frequency category ‘Unknown’ is not accepted, as this does not 
provide useful guidance for the prescriber or patient and may lead to falsely underestimate the 
relevance of this risk. 
The MAH has cited guidance which refers to labelling the absolute numbers of cases and ADR 
frequencies based on spontaneous reporting systems exclusively. This is not entirely applicable to the 
current situation as the MAH has referred to several post-marketing sources, including well-conducted 
observational studies (hence not spontaneous reporting systems exclusively) that have provided 
frequency estimates of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination, albeit variable in different

patient populations/jurisdictions. However, it should be noted that the variability margins can be taken 
into account in the representation in the ADR table in SmPC section 4.8, because the frequency 
designations are represented as ranges.  
In addition to the literature cited by the MAH, the Rapporteur has been notified of two further 
studies by the EMA/VAC4EU (retrospective, multi-database, cohort study) and EPI-PHARE - 
Scientific Interest Group (GIS) ANSM-CNAM (matched case-control study in the FR national health data 
system (SNDS)), which are briefly summarised below in Sections 3.5 and 3.6 of this AR. Full reports 
are included in ANNEX 3 and 4, respectively. 
Based on the currently available combined body of evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing 
Observational studies the incidence for myocarditis ranged from 0.1 to 1.6 per 10,000, hence a 
frequency category Very Rare < 1 per 10,000 in the SmPC section 4.8 would be more appropriate. 
Note that this would also be more in line with the wording already present in SmPC section 4.4. The 
rationale for the frequency category could be explained in sub-section c “Description of selected 
adverse reactions”. I.e. a footnote could be considered noting that the incidence of myocarditis after 
the second dose in the younger males was at the high end of the range and would be closer to 
frequency category rare (≥1/10.000, <1/1.000) 
Regarding refinement of SmPC section 4.4 
In addition, the current wording should be further refined. The current product information section 4.4 
mentions: Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed following vaccination 
with Comirnaty. These cases have primarily occurred within 14 days following vaccination, more often 
after the second vaccination, and more often in younger men. 
It is proposed to remove and replace ‘men’ (which implies adults only) by ‘males’, as also cases have 
been observed in adolescent males aged below 18 years. 
Request for further adjustment of SmPC section 4.4 when more robust data become available 
Based on the O/E analyses presented by the MAH (Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3) it is noted that 
although the absolute number of cases in males is higher, the background incidence in males is also 
higher. Consequently, the O/E ratios above 1 do not really differ that much between males and 
females. This aspect is currently not reflected in the current wording in SmPC section 4.4. On the other 
hand, the numbers of female cases shown here, but also in the epidemiological studies cited by the 
MAH (as well as those conducted by VAC4EU and EPI-PHARE) are low, especially in the younger 
females, which raises the question regarding robustness of these estimates. 
The MAH should commit to remain closely evaluating the risk estimates in females, and in case more 
(robust, stable) data would become available, provide a proposal for refined/adjusted the wording in 
SmPC section 4.4, as appropriate.

ABSTRACT  
Background:  
Reports of myocarditis in young males occurring after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination have emerged.  
Methods:  
We conducted nationwide cohort studies in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden according to a 
common protocol and combined results by meta-analysis. We retrieved SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations, 
hospital diagnoses of myocarditis or pericarditis, and covariates from national registers. We followed all 
residents 12 years and older from December 27, 2020, until an incident myocarditis or pericarditis, 
censoring or end-of-study (October 5, 2021). Poisson regression yielded adjusted incidence rate ratios 
(RRs) and excess rates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), comparing rates in 28-day and 7-day 
periods following vaccination with unvaccinated rates.  
Results:  
Among 23.1 million individuals, (82% vaccinated by end-of-study) we identified 1092 myocarditis and 
1154 pericarditis events. Within the 28-day period, second-dose vaccinations with BNT162b2 and 
mRNA-1273 were associated with higher risk of myocarditis, adjusted RRs 1.86 (95% CI, 1.5-2.3) and 
7.2 (5.3-9.8), respectively. In males 16-24 years of age RRs were 5.4 (3.8 to 7.6) and 14.2 (8.4 to 
23.8), and excess events 5.7 (3.6 to 7.5) and 18.8 (9.6 to 28.0) per 100,000 vaccinations,

respectively. RRs for the 7-day period were higher. For pericarditis, results pointed in the same 
direction.  
Conclusion:  
First- and second-dose vaccinations with mRNA vaccines were associated with higher risk of 
myocarditis and pericarditis. Associations were strongest for myocarditis in young males after second 
vaccination: our data are compatible with between 4 and 8 excess events in 28 days per 100,000 after 
BNT162b2, and between 10 and 28 per 100,000 after mRNA-1273. 
INTRODUCTION 
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved four vaccines against SARS-CoV-2: BNT162b2 
(Pfizer–BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), AZD1222 (AstraZeneca), and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen). The 
Nordic countries have primarily used the two mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273. These 
vaccines have proven to be efficient and safe, but cases of myocarditis or pericarditis during the first 
weeks after vaccination have been reported.1  
Case reports and surveillance data from the United States indicate an increased risk of myocarditis 
after vaccination with an mRNA vaccine, higher after second dose and higher in young men.2–7 Israeli 
data on risk of myocarditis after vaccination with BNT162b2 have shown a higher risk after a second 
dose and a higher risk in young men.8,9 Surveillance data from Canada indicates a higher increase of 
myocarditis after mRNA-1273 than after BNT162b2.10  
In nationwide cohort studies in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, we evaluated the risks of 
myocarditis and pericarditis following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in a combined population of 23.1 million 
individuals. High-quality nationwide registers allowed us to calculate exact unvaccinated and 
vaccinated person-time at risk for each individual to evaluate the risk by vaccine product, vaccination 
number, sex, and age. 
METHODS  
SETTING AND DATA SOURCES  
We conducted population-based cohort studies in four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and 
Sweden) comprising linked data from nationwide health registers on SARS-CoV2 vaccination, 
myocarditis and pericarditis diagnoses and other covariates (Suppl Methods). All Nordic residents are 
assigned a unique personal identifier at birth or immigration, which we used for linking data between 
registers. All Nordic countries have universal and tax-financed healthcare systems and reporting to 
national registers is mandatory, providing near-complete follow-up of all residents over time.11 Each 
cohort study was analyzed according to a common protocol and results combined by use of meta-
analyses. 
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
Within the supplementary materials details have been provided regarding quality, validity and 
completeness of the relevant characteristics and outcome variables (e.g. vaccination information, 
COVID testing results, comorbidities). The authors confirmed that vaccination data recorded in the 
respective registries is complete and accurate, as well as the data on the outcomes.

STUDY POPULATION  
We included 23,124,459 million persons aged 12 years and older, consisting of all residents in any of 
the countries on January 1, 2017, alive and still residing within the country on December 27, 2020. We 
excluded XXaround20,000XX persons with any myocarditis or pericarditis in inpatient or outpatient 
hospital care from January 1, 2017, to December 26, 2020 (Suppl Methods). [In the supplementary 
methods it is stated: “In total, XXX were excluded, whereof 3706 from Denmark, XXX from Finland, 
4864 from Norway, and 8477 from Sweden.”].3 
SARS-COV-2 VACCINATION  
The Nordic countries implemented national vaccination campaigns against SARS-CoV-2 from December 
27, 2020, providing free vaccinations to all residents. Phased distribution plans were implemented 
prioritizing vaccination of individuals at highest risk of COVID-19 complications, firstly nursing home 
residents, and subsequently healthcare workers, older age groups, medical risk groups, and finally the 
youngest age groups. Denmark, Finland and Norway almost exclusively used mRNA vaccines after full 
or partial discontinuing use of AZD1222 in March 2021 due to reported serious adverse events.12,13 
Sweden used AZD1222 for a majority of those 65 years and older and mRNA vaccines in other age 
groups. Ad26.COV2.S has seen very limited use. The Nordic countries have vaccinated 4 to 6 times 
more individuals with BNT162b2 than with mRNA-1273. We studied risk of myocarditis and pericarditis 
in 28-day risk periods after administration date of the first and second dose of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 
and AZD1222 (Figure 4).

Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
The authors confirm that the reference group is defined as all person time from December 27, 2020 
until the (possibly) first vaccination, i.e. a few of months. Hence, the duration of the study is quite 
short. People who do not get vaccinated during the study period contribute all their person-time to the 
reference group. 
The exposure time (main analysis: 0-28 days after vaccination) is by definition after the reference time: 
this means that everyone who is exposed has to 'survive' until this period, without an event. Since the 
outcome is rare, this is considered acceptable. 
A  post  exposure  window  is  defined  in  the  methods,  however,  no  results  have  been  shown  regarding 
these time periods. In the authors’ discussion it is mentioned that “Potentially, future research utilizing 
post risk time comparison time will provide help in excluding time-dependent unmeasured confounding”.  
MYOCARDITIS AND PERICARDITIS  
We defined incident outcome events as the date of first admission for myocarditis or pericarditis from 
December 27, 2020, and onwards. The primary outcome was a main or secondary diagnosis of 
myocarditis at discharge from inpatient hospital care. Secondary outcomes included a main or 
secondary diagnosis of pericarditis (inpatient hospital care), and a main or secondary diagnosis of 
either condition (myocarditis or pericarditis) combined from either inpatient or outpatient hospital care.

COVARIATES  
We used the following covariates for adjustment and stratification: sex, age, calendar time (categories 
below), healthcare worker status, nursing home resident, and five comorbidities (pulmonary disease, 
renal disease, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease or diabetes, and cancer) defined by 
diagnoses before start of follow-up. We also adjusted for verified SARS-CoV-2 infection before 
December 27, 2020, while infection after this date was a censoring event. We defined SARS-CoV-2 as 
the sample date of a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or lateral flow test. 
Testing has been free and easily available in all counties since summer of 2020. 
Comment PRAC rapporteur: 
Although adjustment of the results using the covariates mentioned may correct for some biases, a 
thorough discussion of possible sources of selection bias is currently missing. I.e. were the baseline 
characteristics and risk factors of myocarditis/ pericarditis evenly distributed between vaccinated 
vs. unvaccinated people? A table detailing baseline characteristics of the vaccinated and unvaccinated 
groups would be helpful. A sensitivity analysis excluding people without any COVID-19 vaccination 
might also be helpful to diminish bias, and help interpretation of findings.  
Further, the number of covariates included is limited. No co-medications that are potential risk factors 
for myocarditis have been incorporated, such as medication to treat cancer, antibiotics (such as 
penicillin and sulfonamide drugs), diuretics (such as furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide), and 
medication for epilepsy. 
Also, no time-dependent adjustments were made, but only adjustments for covariates measured at 
baseline. 
The authors discussed ascertainment bias as follows: “Ascertainment bias, whereby increased focus on 
myocarditis as an adverse event after mRNA vaccination has resulted in more subclinical cases being 
diagnosed, cannot be ruled out. However, it is unlikely to fully explain the difference between the two 
mRNA vaccines or the differences between age groups. The background incidence rates of both 
myocarditis and pericarditis are similar in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, whereas in Norway the rate 
of myocarditis is lower and the rate of pericarditis higher. However, the combined rates of myocarditis 
and pericarditis are very similar across the countries.” This is endorsed. 
Regarding potential confounding by age and by calendar-time: analyses have been stratified by sex 
and  age groups (12-15, 16-24, 25-39 and 40+), however, findings in children 12-15 years are limited 
because of relatively few exposed individuals as vaccination in this age group had only recently started 
in most countries at the time the study was performed. Adjustment for calendar-time did not change 
the results substantially. 
In summary, residual bias /confounding may be present in the study because of selection bias 
(vaccinated versus unvaccinated people), limited adjustment for covariates and lack of time-dependent 
adjustments.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
We took advantage of the longitudinal information in our national cohorts to calculate exact 
unvaccinated and vaccinated person-time at risk for each individual. We started follow-up on 
December 27, 2020, coinciding with the start of the vaccination campaign in all four countries. 
Censoring events were defined as the first occurrence of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
receiving Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, receiving a third dose of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, emigration, death,

or country-specific end-of-study (latest October 5, 2021). Individuals contributed person-time as 
unvaccinated until the first vaccination. After each first- or second-dose vaccination, individuals 
contributed with person-time in a main risk period of interest defined as day 0 up to and including day 
28. The resulting follow-up periods and numbers of myocarditis and pericarditis cases were aggregated 
for all individuals according to vaccination status (unvaccinated, risk period after first-dose vaccination, 
and risk period after second-dose vaccination).  
We used Poisson regression on the number of cases to estimate incidence rate ratios (RRs) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) comparing rates in the main risk periods after vaccination to rates in 
unvaccinated periods. We took potential confounding factors into account by direct adjustment in three 
models: Model 1: adjustment for sex and age (12-15, 16-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-39, 40-64, 65+ years); 
model 2: adjustment as in model 1 with additional adjustment for healthcare worker status, nursing 
home resident, and the comorbidities above; model 3: adjustment as in model 2 with additional 
adjustment for calendar periods (December-March, April-June, July-end). Model 2 was used to 
estimate adjusted RRs in our main analyses; models 1 and 3 were used as sensitivity analyses. We 
include subgroup results according to sex and age (12-15, 16-24, 25-39 and 40+ years). We 
conducted the analyses with SAS 9.4 (Denmark, Sweden), R version 3.6.3 (Finland), and Stata 16.0 
(Norway). 
META-ANALYSES  
Meta-analyses of the IRR estimates were based on random-effects models implemented using mixmeta 
package14 of R15. We tested homogeneity of country-specific estimates using the Cochran Q test,16 
calculated the pooled incidence rates (IRs) using the sum of events and person years in the countries 
and the pooled excess rates using the pooled IR and IRR estimates. For the CIs we utilized the delta 
method assuming independence of the IR and IRR estimates.  
SARS-COV2 INFECTION AND MYOCARDITIS  
In a complementary analysis we studied incident myocarditis within 28 days following SARS-CoV-2 
infection. Using the analytic approach as above and with the sample date of the first positive test after 
August 1, 2020, defining the exposure start.  
SUPPLEMENTARY ANALYSES  
We studied risk of myocarditis or pericarditis in a shorter 7-day risk window. Among events after 
vaccination, we calculated median time from vaccination to outcome (admission date). Further, we 
analyzed short-term outcomes among myocarditis cases using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, by 
estimating the proportion of cases discharged day 4 or later, and the proportion of cases who died 
within 28 days of the admission date.

RESULTS  
Within the four Nordic countries in the study, 23,124,459 residents were followed from December 27, 
2020, to Oct 5, 2021, at the latest; 17,384,090 (75.2%) had received two doses and 1,494,826 (6.5 
%) had received one dose only of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines by end-of-study (Table 1). 
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
It is understood that around 20,000 persons (exact number seems unknown) were excluded with any 
myocarditis or pericarditis in inpatient or outpatient hospital care from January 1, 2017, to December 
26, 2020. In the Supplementary Methods it is mentioned that “In total, XXX were excluded, whereof 
3706 from Denmark, XXX from Finland, 4864 from Norway, and 8477 from Sweden.”4

MYOCARDITIS AND PERICARDITIS DURING FOLLOW-UP  
During the 28-day risk-periods following vaccination and during unvaccinated periods experienced by 
our study participants (6.7 million person-years in total), we observed 1092 incident myocarditis cases 
and 1154 incident pericarditis cases. Incidence rates of myocarditis during unvaccinated time was 9.7 
per 100,000 person-years for men, and 4.2 for women (Table 2). Among 16- to 24-year-old, 
incidence rates were 18.7 for men and 4.4 for women. Incidence rates of pericarditis increased with 
increasing age.

VACCINATION AND MYOCARDITIS  
During the 28-day risk period, we observed 106 and 123 myocarditis cases following first- and second-
dose vaccinations with BNT162b2, respectively, and 15 and 67 following mRNA-1273, respectively. 
Adjusted RRs comparing the 28-day risk periods following first- and second-dose vaccinations to 
unvaccinated periods were 1.4 (95%CI, 1.1 to 1.7) and 1.9 (95%CI, 1.5 to 2.3) for BNT162b2 and 1.2 
(95%CI, 0.7 to 1.9) and 7.2 (95%CI, 5.3 to 9.8) for mRNA-1273. In males, following the first and 
second dose, adjusted RRs were 1.5 (95%CI, 1.1 to 1.8) and 2.2 (95%CI, 1.8 to 2.8) for BNT162b2, 
and 1.5 (95%CI, 0.8 to 2.5) and 9.1 (95%CI, 6.9 to 12) for mRNA-1273.  
In males, 16-24 years of age, the adjusted RR was 5.4 (95%CI, 3.8 to 7.6) for a second dose of 
BNT162b2 and 14.2 (95%CI, 8.4—23.8) for mRNA-1273. For females, the comparative adjusted IRRs 
were lower (Table 2).  
Among all males, the excess number of events per 100,000 vaccinated in the 28-day risk periods were 
0.3 (95%CI, 0.1 to 0.5) and 0.8 (95%CI, 0.6 to 1.0) following first and second doses for BNT162b2, 
and 0.3 (95%CI, -0.1 to 0.8) and 5.4 (95%CI, 4.0 to 6.8) following first and second doses for mRNA-
1273. The excess number of events for females were low (Table 2).  
Among males 16–24 years, the excess number of events per 100,000 vaccinated in the 28-day risk 
periods following first and second doses were 1.7 (95%CI, 0.8 to 2.5) and 5.7 (95%CI, 3.9 to 7.5) for 
BNT162b2 and 1.7 (95%CI, -0.2 to 3.7) and 18.8 (95%CI, 9.6 to 28.0) for mRNA-1273.The 
corresponding excess number of events for males 25 to 39 years of age were somewhat lower (Table 
2).  
In a mixed schedule (BNT162b2—mRNA-1273), close to 40 cases (34 males) occurred following the 
second dose. In males 16-24 years, 17 cases occurred, with an excess number of events of 26.5 
(95%CI, 13.9 to 39.1) (Table 2).  
VACCINATION AND PERICARDITIS  
Pericarditis in males followed a similar pattern by vaccine product and age as for myocarditis but with 
lower RRs. Pericarditis was rare in females 12–39 years. In men 16–24 years, the excess number of 
events within the 28-day risk periods was 7.0 per 100,000 vaccinated (95%CI, 1.4 to 12.7). 
VACCINATION AND MYOCARDITIS OR PERICARDITIS COMBINED  
IRRs of myocarditis or pericarditis combined in males 16–24 years were close to those of myocarditis 
(Table 3). In males 25–39 years the RRs were generally lower. In females 16–24 years the IRRs were 
similar to those of males of the same age, however, with wider confidence intervals.

SARS-COV-2 INFECTION AND MYOCARDITIS  
During the 28-day risk period after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test there were 67 myocarditis cases. 
Excess events of myocarditis were 5.4 (95%CI, 3.7 to 7.1) per 100,000 diagnosed infected in all 
males, and 3.7 (95%CI, 1.1 to 6.4) in males 25–39 years. In females these numbers were similar.

SUPPLEMENTARY ANALYSES  
IRRs and excess rates slightly attenuated, when Model1 was complemented by other covariates 
(Model2) and further attenuated when calendar time was added (Model3). When estimating RRs of 
myocarditis risk following second dose of mRNA-1273 in men 16–24 years, adjustment for calendar 
time (model3) yielded unstable estimates with wide 95% CIs.  
Heterogeneity of the analyses across countries was not statistically significant, and we thus present the 
results as pooled four-country estimates of risk ratios and excess rates.  
We also evaluated a 7-day risk period. Of the 228 myocarditis cases in the 28-day risk-window after a 
second dose of mRNA 145 vaccination, events occurred within the first week, yielding higher IRRs 
(Table 3). The excess events, per 100,000 vaccinated, during 7-day risk-window represented the 
majority of excess events during the 28-day risk-window.  
In males 12–39 years, at least 75% of the cases were admitted to hospital within 10 days of 
vaccination. Comorbid conditions did not differ markedly between vaccinated and unvaccinated cases. 
Length of stay did not markedly differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated cases.  
DISCUSSION  
This study of 23.1 million individuals shows higher rates of myocarditis and pericarditis within 28 days 
following vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines when compared to unvaccinated. These 
associations were strongest within the first 7 days, were increased for all combinations of mRNA 
vaccines and were more pronounced after the second dose. A second dose of mRNA-1273, either after 
mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 as a first dose, had the highest risk. Young males aged 16-24 years had the 
highest increased risk.  
We confirm a higher risk after a second dose and a higher risk in young men.8–10,18,19 Excess events 
within 28 days in young males of 5.7 per 100,000 after a second-dose vaccination with BNT162b2 and 
18.8 after a second-dose vaccination with mRNA-1273 are higher than previously reported.2,8,19 Our 
finding of a higher risk of myocarditis after mRNA-1273 than after BNT162b2 in young males is 
supported by surveillance data from Canada and the US.3,10  
STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS  
The main strengths of our study include the population-based cohort design in four Nordic countries, 
the large sample size, complete follow-up, and independent ascertainment of vaccinations and 
diagnoses from nationwide registers to which reporting is mandatory. The findings in the meta-
analyses are supported by consistent findings across all four countries, despite some country-specific 
differences in data sources, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, testing activities, and vaccination schedules.  
There are also some limitations of the study. We defined myocarditis and pericarditis as an inpatient 
hospital admission with a corresponding main or secondary discharge diagnosis. Diagnostic codes have 
been shown to have a 85% positive predictive value male patients below the age of 60.20 Thus, 
without access to data on clinical measures like troponin levels, diagnostic imaging results, or 
endomyocardial biopsy we studied myocarditis as diagnosed in clinical practice and could therefore not 
assess how many of these patients fulfil all criteria for a myocarditis diagnosis.21 However, median 
length-of-stay was 4-5 days for both unvaccinated and vaccinated cases indicative of sufficient time for 
adequate diagnostic procedures.

We were able to present analyses stratified by sex in younger ages, however, our findings in children 
12-15 years are limited to relatively few exposed individuals as vaccination in this age group has just 
recently started in most countries.  
Ascertainment bias, whereby increased focus on myocarditis as an adverse event after mRNA 
vaccination has resulted in more subclinical cases being diagnosed, cannot be ruled out. However, it is 
unlikely to fully explain the difference between the two mRNA vaccines or the differences between age 
groups. The background incidence rates of both myocarditis and pericarditis are similar in Denmark, 
Finland, and Sweden, whereas in Norway the rate of myocarditis is lower and the rate of pericarditis 
higher. However, the combined rates of myocarditis and pericarditis are very similar across the 
countries.  
We show increased risks of myocarditis after COVID-19 compared to those unexposed to neither 
SARS-CoV-2 infection nor vaccination. COVID-19 related myocarditis is associated with severe disease, 
and more frequent in older subjects. Therefore, estimates of myocarditis risk with COVID-19 will be 
dependent on the testing strategy, appearing less frequent the more mild or pauci-symptomatic cases 
are diagnosed. We limited our follow-up to a time period of most large-scale testing. The risk of 
myocarditis after vaccination was highest in the younger age groups, whereas the risk of myocarditis 
after SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased with decreasing age.  
The two mRNA vaccines have been utilized according to their availability during 2021. Further, 
vaccination was first provided for the elderly and for the younger age groups only later. The 
implementation has thus varied across age and calendar months and across countries. The background 
incidence rate of myocarditis fluctuates with infectious-disease burden, usually higher during the fall 
and winter.22 Moreover, differences in lockdown measures affecting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and 
other viruses, could also affect the background incidence rate in both the unvaccinated and the 
vaccinated. Most of the younger age groups were vaccinated in July, August and September, and very 
few during the spring. However, adjustment for calendar-time did not change the results substantially. 
Potentially, future research utilizing post risk time comparison time will provide help in excluding time-
dependent unmeasured confounding.  
In this Nordic cohort study of 23.1 million individuals 12 years and older, the risk of myocarditis was 
higher within 28 days of vaccination compared to unvaccinated with both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, 
higher after second than first dose. The risk was more pronounced after the second dose of mRNA-
1273 than after the second dose of BNT162b2. The risk was highest in males 16-24 years with 4 to 8 
excess events within 28 days per 100,000 vaccinees after a second dose of BNT162b2 and 10 to 28 
excess events after second dose of mRNA-1273.

3.4.  Rapporteur’s Discussion on results from Nordic study 
Karlstad et al. conducted nationwide cohort studies in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden 
according to a common protocol and combined results by meta-analysis. They retrieved SARS-CoV-2 
vaccinations, hospital diagnoses of myocarditis or pericarditis, and covariates from national registers. 
All residents 12 years and older were followed from December 27, 2020, until an incident myocarditis 
or pericarditis, censoring or end-of-study (October 5, 2021). Poisson regression yielded adjusted 
incidence rate ratios (RRs) and excess rates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), comparing rates in 
28-day and 7-day periods following vaccination with unvaccinated rates.  
The  non-interventional  cohort  study  in  the  Nordic  registries  evaluating  the  risk  of  myocarditis  and 
pericarditis following immunisation with COVID-19 vaccines is a welcomed addition to data from previous 
spontaneous reporting from outside the EEA. The new data, based on Scandinavian national population 
registers linked to vaccination and health care registries in the respective countries, contribute with new 
information regarding the magnitude of risk for the two respective vaccines, including in different age 
strata although estimates in several strata are based on low numbers. 
There are some limitations to the study: 
- 
The reference group is defined as all person time from December 27, 2020 until the (possibly) 
first vaccination, i.e. a few of months. Hence, the duration of the study is quite short.  
- 
The authors did not provide details regarding the participant flow, or number eligible 
vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects.  
- 
People who do not get vaccinated during the study period contribute all their person-time to 
the reference group, which may lead to selection bias. 
- 
The exposure time (main analysis: 0-28 days after vaccination) is by definition after the 
reference time: this means that everyone who is exposed has to 'survive' until this period, 
without an event.  
-  A post exposure window is defined in the methods, however, no results have been shown 
regarding these time periods.  
-  Residual bias /confounding  may be present because of selection bias (vaccinated versus 
unvaccinated people), limited adjustment for covariates (e.g. no adjustment for co-mediation) 
and lack of time-dependent adjustments.

However, these nationwide studies are considered helpful in further quantifying risks of myocarditis or 
pericarditis in relation to SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. 
The study results show that among 23.1 million individuals, (82% vaccinated by end-of-study) 1092 
myocarditis and 1154 pericarditis events were identified. 
During the 28-day risk-periods following vaccination and during unvaccinated periods experienced by 
the study participants (6.7 million person-years in total), 1092 incident myocarditis cases were 
observed. Incidence rates of myocarditis during unvaccinated time was 9.7 per 100,000 person-years 
for men, and 4.2 for women. Among 16- to 24-year-old, incidence rates were 18.7 for men and 4.4 for 
women. 
Incidence rates of myocarditis within 28 days after first- and second-dose BNT162B2 vaccination was 
12.6 and 18.5 per 100,000 person-years for men, and 6.1 and 5.7 per 100,000 person-years for 
women. Among 16- to 24-year-old, incidence rates were 39 and 91,3 per 100,000 person-years for 
men and <frequency unknown> and 10.9 per 100,000 person-years for women. 
Adjusted RRs comparing the 28-day risk periods following first- and second-dose vaccinations to 
unvaccinated periods were 1.4 (95%CI, 1.1 to 1.7) and 1.9 (95%CI, 1.5 to 2.3) for BNT162b2. In 
males, following the first and second dose, adjusted RRs were 1.4 (95%CI, 1.1 to 1.8) and 2.2 
(95%CI, 1.8 to 2.8) for BNT162b2. In females, following the first and second dose, adjusted RRs were 
1.5 (95%CI, 1.0 to 2.1) and 1.3 (95%CI, 0.8 to 2.1) for BNT162b2. In males, 16-24 years of age, the 
adjusted RR was 5.4 (95%CI, 3.8 to 7.6) for a second dose of BNT162b2. In females, 16-24 years of 
age, the adjusted RR was 2.7 (95%CI, 1.1 to 7.1) for a second dose of BNT162b2.   
Among all males, the excess number of events per 100,000 vaccinated in the 28-day risk periods were 
0.3 (95%CI, 0.1 to 0.5) and 0.8 (95%CI, 0.6 to 1.0) following first and second doses for BNT162b2. 
Among males 16–24 years, the excess number of events per 100,000 vaccinated in the 28-day risk 
periods following first and second doses were 1.7 (95%CI, 0.8 to 2.5) and 5.7 (95%CI, 3.9 to 7.5) for 
BNT162b2. Among all females, the excess number of events per 100,000 vaccinated in the 28-day risk 
periods were 0.2 (95%CI, 0.0 to 0.3) and 0.1 (95%CI, 0.0 to 0.3) following first and second doses for 
BNT162b2. Among females 16–24 years, the excess number of events per 100,000 vaccinated in the 
28-day risk periods following first and second doses were 0.2 (95%CI, 0.1 to 0.5) and 0.5 (95%CI, 0.0 
to 1.1) for BNT162b2.  
Incidence rates of pericarditis during unvaccinated time was 10.2 per 100,000 person-years for men, 
and 4.8 for women.  
Incidence rates of pericarditis within 28 days after first- and second-dose BNT162B2 vaccination was 
16.7 and 17.7 per 100,000 person-years for men, and 7.5 and 8.1 per 100,000 person-years for 
women.  
In males, following the first and second dose, adjusted RRs were 1.3 (95%CI, 1.0 to 1.7) and 1.4 
(95%CI, 1.1 to 1.8) for BNT162b2. In females, following the first and second dose, adjusted RRs were 
1.3 (95%CI, 0.9 to 1.7) and 1.5 (95%CI, 1.1 to 2.1) for BNT162b2. For both men and women, RRs 
were highest in the younger age groups (16-39 years); around a 2-fold or 3-fold increase. 
Among all males, the excess number of events per 100,000 vaccinated in the 28-day risk periods were 
0.3 (95%CI, 0.0 to 0.6) and 0.4 (95%CI, 0.2 to 0.6) following first and second doses for BNT162b2. 
Among males 16–24 years, the excess number of events per 100,000 vaccinated in the 28-day risk 
periods following first and second doses were 0.1 (95%CI, 0.4 to 0.5) and 1 (95%CI, 0.2 to 1.8) for 
BNT162b2. Among all females, the excess number of events per 100,000 vaccinated in the 28-day risk 
periods were 0.1 (95%CI, 0.0 to 0.3) and 0.2 (95%CI, 0.0 to 0.4) following first and second doses for

Comments EMA received  22 Nov 2021 
On 22 November a slide set with a summary and appraisal for the Nordic study was received by the 
Rapporteur, which is summarised below. The results of the Nordic and EPI-PHAR FR studies seem to 
converge overall, this is also supported by the use of two different study designs with different 
strengths and limitations. 
Main Results: 
• 
• 
• 
75.2% of study population with two doses by end of study period 
1092 incident myocarditis and 1154 incident pericarditis cases in the study period 
Incidence of myocarditis during unvaccinated time: 9.7/100,000 (men) and 4.2/100,000 
(women); 18.7 and 4.4 resp. among 16-24-year-olds. Incidence of pericarditis increased with 
age 
• 
Adjusted RRs for myocarditis (28-day risk period): 1.4 (95%CI, 1.1 to 1.7) and 1.9 (95%CI,

resp. 
•  Males 16-24: 5.4 (95%CI, 3.8 to 7.6) for 2nd dose of BNT162b2 and 14.2 (95%CI, 
8.4—23.8) for mRNA-1273. Females: IRRs lower (Supp. analysis) 
•  Males: excess number of events/100,000 vaccinated 0.3 (95%CI, 0.1 to 0.5) after first 
and 0.8 (95%CI, 0.6 to 1.0) after 2nd dose for BNT162b2, and 0.3 (95%CI, -0.1 to 0.8) 
and 5.4 (95%CI, 4.0 to 6.8) for mRNA-1273. Excess number in females low. In 16–24 
years males: 1.7 (95%CI, 0.8 to 2.5) and 5.7 (95%CI, 3.9 to 7.5) for BNT162b2 and 
1.7 (95%CI, -0.2 to 3.7) and 18.8 (95%CI, 9.6 to 28.0) for mRNA-1273. Lower for 25-
39 years of age 
•  Mixed schedule (BNT162b2—mRNA-1273): 34 cases in males after 2nd dose incl. 17 
cases in 16-24 years, with excess number of events 26.5 (95%CI, 13.9 to 39.1) 
•  Pericarditis: similar pattern as myocarditis in males but lower IRRs. Rare in females 12–39 
years. In men 16–24, excess number of events in 28-day risk period 7.0/100,000 vaccinated 
(95%CI, 1.4 to 12.7) 
•  Myocarditis + pericarditis: IRRs in males 16–24 years close to those of myocarditis, 
generally lower for 25–39 years. Females 16–24 years: IRRs similar to males of same age but 
wider CIs 
•  SARS-COV-2 infection and myocarditis: 67 cases during 28-day risk period after positive 
test. Excess events 5.4/100,000 (95%CI, 3.7 to 7.1) in males, similar in females

•  Supplementary analyses 
•  Unstable estimates with wide 95% CIs for myocarditis after 2nd dose of mRNA-1273 in 
men 16–24 years 
• 
Sensitivity analysis shows that excess events/100,000 during the 7-day risk window 
represented the majority of excess events 
•  >75% male cases 12–39 years admitted to hospital within 10 days of vaccination. 
Comorbid conditions and length of stay did not differ markedly between vaccinated and 
unvaccinated cases 
Strengths 
•  Well-conducted pharmacoepidemiological study, capturing the entire national population in the 
4 countries with a total study population >23 million 
•  Common protocol used in the 4 national studies 
•  Completeness of data: reporting to nationwide registers is mandatory 
•  Heterogeneity in meta-analysis not statistically significant (despite some country differences in 
data sources, transmission, testing, vaccination schedules) 
•  Clearly defined washout period (e.g., exclusion of myocarditis/pericarditis cases in inpatient/ 
outpatient hospital care from Jan. 2017 to Dec. 26, 2020) and case definition for outcome 
events  
• 
• 
Appropriate adjustments for likely confounders 
Sensitivity analyses 
•  Calculation of the number of excess cases in the vaccinated population important from a public 
health/policy perspective  
Limitations 
•  Outcomes defined as inpatient hospital admission with main or secondary discharge diagnosis 
(PPV 85% for male patients <60 years). However, no clinical data (e.g., troponin, imaging 
results) available to complement diagnosis (but non-differential median length-of-stay by 
vaccination status) 
Limited exposure data for children 12-15  
According to authors ascertainment bias cannot be ruled out (but similar background incidence 
rates in the 4 countries)

• 
As in other COVID-19 vaccine observational safety studies, risk estimates are affected by 
national vaccination strategies (implementation varying by age and calendar months and 
across countries), testing strategies, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and COVID-19

Potential time-dependent unmeasured confounding  
Potential issue of comparability between vaccinated/unvaccinated groups could have been 
addressed using an additional self-controlled design which would allow adjusting for temporal 
variations in baseline incidence

Authors’ conclusion 
• 
This study of 23.1 million individuals shows higher rates of myocarditis and pericarditis within 
28 days following vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines when compared to 
unvaccinated. These associations were strongest within the first 7 days, were increased for all 
combinations of mRNA vaccines and were more pronounced after the second dose. A second 
dose of mRNA-1273, either after mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 as a first dose, had the highest 
risk. Young males aged 16-24 years had the highest increased risk. 
• 
Excess events within 28 days in young males of 5.7 per 100,000 after a second-dose 
vaccination with BNT162b2 and 18.8 after a second-dose vaccination with mRNA-1273 are 
higher than previously reported. Our finding of a higher risk of myocarditis after mRNA-1273 
than after BNT162b2 in young males is supported by surveillance data from Canada and the 
US

Rationale and background:  
PRAC is currently assessing the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis associated with COVID-19 vaccines 
following reports with mRNA platform vaccines in young adults and children. 
Primary objective 
To estimate the incidence rate of myocarditis/pericarditis (MYO/PERI) in children and adults across 
different study periods and study populations, prior to vaccination and following vaccination 
by age group, and by data source.  
Secondary objectives 
The secondary objectives for the rapid assessment studies is: 
To assess the incidence rate of  myocarditis and pericarditis the following subgroups 
o  persons with the presence of co-morbidities elevating the risk of serious COVID-19 
o  persons with a history of diagnosed COVID-19 disease  
o  age groups (0-4, 5-11, 12-17, 18-24, 25-29, and in 10-year categories above  
Study design:  
A retrospective, multi-database, cohort study, conducted during the study period ranging from 
December 1, 2020, to the latest availability of data.  
Population:  
All subjects in the source population in the participating data sources who were in follow-up for at least 
365 days on December 1, 2020 or were born into the cohort during the study period, and for whom 
vaccination data would be able to be obtained/linked.  
Variables: 
Variables of interest are:

Person-time: birth and death dates as well as periods of observation.  
Events: dates of medical and/or procedure and/or prescription/dispensing codes to identify AESI, 
COVID-19, and at-risk medical conditions. 
•  Vaccines: vaccine brands and doses 
Data sources:  
A total of more than 20 million subjects were included in the study population from ARS Tuscany, 
BIFAP Spain and CPRD, UK.  BIFAP subpopulations were followed from various regions, some could link 
primary care data to hospital data and/or COVID-registry data or had only primary care data. These 
subpopulations and their rates are reported separately. For CPRD we present only vaccination data, as 
the event rates did not pass quality control and need to be revisited, they will be updated for the next 
round.  
Results 
Study population 
The study population comprised 3.147.663 from ARS-Tuscany, 2.949.955 from BIFAP regions that 
could link to hospitalization and 5.339.434 of BIFAP sources that could link between GP and COVID 
register. CPRD had more than 12 million subjects, for which we could analyse the vaccination data. 
Mean age was around 50 years of age in all data sources, except for CPRD were the mean was at 45 
years of age. Event data from CPRD are not reported here as they did not pass quality control. They 
will be reported next time, PHARMO could only access GP data, and is not included in this analysis.

The most frequently used vaccines were Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) and AstraZeneca 
(Vaxzevria). There were relatively low number of vaccinations in BIFAP PCHOSP, since one region was 
censored before start of vaccination. The different countries have used different vaccination strategies. 
The Janssen vaccine was not used in the UK. The majority of persons in the UK received the 
AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which was less than 20% of all COVID-19 vaccines in Italy and Spain. 
In those countries the majority of subjects received the Pfizer vaccine. The UK also had much longer 
distances between COVID-19 vaccine doses, both for AstraZeneca as well as for Pfizer, the distance 
was less for Moderna. In Italy and Spain, Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine doses were given 
rapidly (within a month) after each other, whereas AstraZeneca second dose COVID-19 vaccine also 
was prolonged to almost 3 months.   
Covid-19 disease 
There are a total of 1,215,768 persons who had a recorded COVID-19 disease during the study period.

COVID-19 disease increased the rate of myocarditis and pericarditis especially in younger age groups  
Incidence rates of myocarditis and/or pericarditis in vaccinated 
In this report we provided the rates of myocarditis and pericarditis post-vaccination and compare them 
with age specific background rates. We also include the excel sheets with detailed data and stratified 
data on incidence rates. We observed that myocarditis rates post-vaccination were very rare, whereas 
pericarditis was more frequent. To have more ability to detect elevations we combined myocarditis and 
pericarditis in the comparison. 
The comparison of incidence shows that there is excess incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis in 
younger adult age groups, and this is more frequent in persons vaccinated with the Pfizer COVID-19 
vaccine (Comirnaty). We did not formally test the significance of the elevation as that was not the 
purpose of this analysis.  
Limitations 
Our data have limitations, although age stratification is done and we compared rates in persons 
without prior COVID-19, confounding may remain. We therefore pursue with a Self-Controlled Risk 
Interval Study, which should be able to deal with the within person confounding and will apply post-
vaccination risk windows and dose analysis. We may not have captured all cases, which is why we 
used various databanks in BIFAP, those GP linked to COVID registry and the GPs who could link to 
hospital data.  
Due to the rapidity of the required response, quality control could not be finalized and CPRD rates were 
not included. We will continue quality control after the delivery of this report, updates of the data will 
be made in November.  
Conclusions 
Based on the descriptive analysis and comparison of incidence rates of myocarditis and pericarditis we 
conclude that COVID-19 disease itself increased the rates of myocarditis & pericarditis and that there is 
an excess rate of myocarditis and pericarditis in younger persons without prior COVID-19 disease, who 
are vaccinated with the mRNA platform COVID-19 vaccines, in particular Comirnaty, which was also 
most widely used. A formal association assessment will require a design that controls for confounding 
such as the SCRI, which is initiated. Because of the limited power in the younger age groups, meta-
analysis of the data with the Nordic data might be beneficial.  
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
This retrospective, multi-database, cohort study, conducted during the study period ranging from 
December 1, 2020, to the latest availability of data is welcomed. 
The limitations of the study are acknowledged. In addition, the authors noted that a total of 
1,215,768 persons had a recorded COVID-19 disease during the study period. Note that especially 
during the initial phases of the pandemic, COVID testing frequency and capacity was not at the same 
level as the current situation. Consequently, it cannot be excluded that children and adolescents may 
have had an asymptomatic COVID-19 (relatively more often than the older age groups) and may have 
not been tested at all. 
The authors’ conclusions are endorsed that based on the descriptive analysis and comparison of 
incidence rates of myocarditis and pericarditis: 
• 
COVID-19 disease itself increased the rates of myocarditis & pericarditis

Summary 
Since July 2021, cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been regarded as adverse side effects 
potentially arising from vaccination against COVID-19 using messenger RNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech 
or Moderna), particularly in young men. More recent data suggest that the risk of myocarditis and 
pericarditis might be higher with the Moderna vaccine, particularly after the second dose, than with the 
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The aim of this study was to measure the link between the Pfizer-BioNTech 
and Moderna vaccines and the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis among all persons aged 12-50 in 
France.  
A matched case-control study was conducted using data from the national health data system (SNDS), 
chain-linked to data from the national databases for Covid-19 vaccination (VAC-SI) and testing (SI-
DEP). All cases of hospitalisation for myocarditis and pericarditis recorded in France between 15 May 
and 31 August 2021 involving patients between the ages of 12 and 50 were included. Each case was 
matched with 10 controls of the same age, gender and département of residence. The relative risk of 
hospitalisation for myocarditis and pericarditis was compared for persons exposed to the Pfizer-
BioNTech and Moderna vaccines and those not exposed, by gender and by age group, using conditional 
models of logistic regression adjusted to account for history of myocarditis or pericarditis in the last 5 
years, infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the previous month, and the deprivation index.  
Across the whole of France, a total of 919 cases of myocarditis (median age 26, 21% women) and 917 
cases of pericarditis (median age 34, 38% women) were recorded in the 12-50 age group during the 
study period. These cases were matched with 9190 controls (for myocarditis) and 9170 controls (for 
pericarditis).  
Overall, vaccination with the Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna vaccines was associated with an increase in 
the risk of hospitalisation for myocarditis and pericarditis in the 7 days following vaccination. The 
association with the risk of myocarditis appears to be particularly strong among young men below the 
age of 30, especially after the second dose of the Moderna vaccine (an adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) of 
79.8 with a 95% confidence interval [29.8-213.4]), with excess cases in the order of 132 per million 
doses administered in this age group. To a lesser extent, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine also appears to 
be associated with an increased risk of myocarditis among men under the age of 30 (OR 2.1 [1.3-3.5] 
with 3 excess cases per million doses for the first dose; OR 10.9 [7.6-15.8] and 27 excess cases per 
million doses for the second dose), and an association with the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, 
albeit not a statistically significant one, cannot be ruled out (OR 2.1 [0.6-7.3]) on account of a lack of

statistical power. Although the incidence of myocarditis is lower than it is among men, this risk also 
increases among young women below the age of 30 following the second dose of both vaccines (OR 
11.4 [4.5-28.6] and 4 excess cases per million doses for Pfizer-BioNTech; 40.6 [9.9-166.4] and 37 
excess cases per million doses for Moderna). The risk of pericarditis also appears to be greater after 
the Moderna vaccine for persons under the age of 30, particularly after the second dose for men (OR 
15.0 [3.3-68.4] and 18 excess cases per million doses) and after the first dose for women (OR 27.9 
[2.4-328.0] and 6 excess cases per million doses). 
The clinical prognosis for these cases of myocarditis and pericarditis appears to be broadly positive, 
with hospitalisation lasting for between 2 and 4 days on average. During the period studied, no deaths 
were reported among the cases of hospitalisation for myocarditis or pericarditis following vaccination.  
Furthermore, multivariate analysis suggests that infection with SARS-CoV-2 within the last month is 
also associated with cases of myocarditis (OR 7.9 [5.0-12.3]) and pericarditis (OR 3.9 [2.3-6.6]).  
In conclusion, this study confirms the existence of a risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in the 7 days 
following vaccination against Covid-19 with mRNA vaccines (Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna) among 
persons aged 12-50, particularly young people under the age of 30. This risk is higher with the 
Moderna vaccine. Nevertheless, the number of cases which can be attributed to vaccines is small in 
relation to the number of doses administered. This study also confirms the positive clinical prognosis 
for cases of myocarditis and pericarditis arising after vaccination. 
Comments PRAC Rapporteur: 
The study conducted in France provides a welcome addition to the body of evidence regarding the 
occurrence of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination. 
In general the authors’ conclusion is endorsed that this study confirms the existence of a risk of 
myocarditis and pericarditis in the 7 days following vaccination against Covid-19 with mRNA vaccines 
(Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna) among persons aged 12-50, particularly young people under the age of 
30. This risk seems higher with the Moderna vaccine. 
Nevertheless, the number of cases which can be attributed to vaccines is small in relation to the 
number of doses administered. 
This study also reports a favorable clinical prognosis for cases of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring 
after vaccination.

3.7.  Rapporteur’s proposed recommendation 
See comments above in the respective sections. 
Based on review of the submitted data the benefit-risk balance remains unchanged. 
Nevertheless, the MAH should adequately address the following: 
Regarding ADR frequency in SmPC 4.8 
The PRAC Rapporteur considers that the current frequency assignment unknown is not accepted. 
The PRAC Rap notes that the current frequency category in 4.8 (frequency unknown) does not 
adequately represent the current body of evidence gathered in the post-marketing phase based on 
observational studies. 
For instance based on the studies cited by the MAH: 
• 
Two studies reported myocarditis and pericarditis frequency following BNT162b2 vaccination 
for all ages combined of 10 (95% CI 6.1-15.4) per million for myocarditis and 18 
(95% CI 13.-25.5) per million for pericarditis in a US healthcare system,xxix and 13.5 
cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis per million doses in Australia.xxx

Information about myocarditis and perimyocarditis by age has been reported by the Israeli 
Ministry of Health as part of their overall COVID-19 Vaccine monitoring (proactive for 
myocarditis). xxxi Among males the reporting rate of myocarditis was lower for individuals 12 to 
15 years of age than for individuals 16 to 19 years of age for both dose 1 (1/196,398=0.51 vs 
3/261,112=1.15 per 100,000 doses) and dose 2 (11/158,541=6.94 vs 37/226,452=16.34 per 
100,000 doses), with rates for both doses declining thereafter with age. 
Based on the currently available combined body of evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing 
observational studies as cited by the MAH  the incidence of myocarditis ranged from 0.1 to 1.6 per 
10,000, hence a frequency category Very Rare < 1 per 10,000 in the SmPC section 4.8 would be 
more appropriate. 
Note that this is would also be more in line with the wording already present in SmPC section 4.4. 
The rationale for the frequency category could be explained in sub-section c “Description of selected 
adverse reactions”. I.e. a footnote could be considered noting that the incidence of myocarditis in the 
younger males was at the high end of the range and would be closer to frequency category rare 
(≥1/10.000, <1/1.000) 
Regarding refinement of SmPC section 4.4 
In addition, the current wording should be further refined. The current product information section 4.4 
mentions: Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed following vaccination 
with Comirnaty. These cases have primarily occurred within 14 days following vaccination, more often 
after the second vaccination, and more often in younger men. 
It is proposed to remove and replace ‘men’ (which implies adults only) by ‘males’, as also cases have 
been observed in adolescent males aged below 18 years.

Request for further adjustment of SmPC section 4.4 when more robust data become available 
Based on the O/E analyses presented by the MAH (Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3) it is noted that 
although the absolute number of cases in males is higher, the background incidence in males is also 
higher. Consequently, the O/E ratios above 1 do not really differ that much between males and 
females. This aspect is currently not reflected in the current wording in SmPC section 4.4. On the other 
hand, the numbers of female cases shown here, but also in the epidemiological studies cited by the 
MAH (as well as those conducted by VAC4EU and EPI-PHARE) are low, especially in the younger 
females, which raises the question regarding robustness of these estimates. 
The MAH should commit to remain closely evaluating the risk estimates in females, and in case more 
(robust, stable) data would become available, provide a proposal for refined/adjusted the wording in 
SmPC section 4.4, as appropriate.  
Characteristics, severity, outcome 
Based on the above reviews of characteristics, severity, duration and outcome of myocarditis and 
pericarditis the current wording in the SmPC section 4.4 regarding disease course is still considered 
adequate. Nevertheless in a considerable number of cases no information on the duration of event, or 
whether the events were resolved is available. The MAH is expected to keep the clinical course, 
severity, outcome, sequelae under close monitoring in both spontaneous reports and ongoing and 
planned observational studies. The Rapporteur should be notified immediately in case of unexpected 
findings or trends.

Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
Section 4.4 Warnings and Precautions 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed following vaccination with 
Comirnaty. These cases have primarily occurred within 14 days following vaccination, more often after 
the second vaccination, and more often in younger men males. Available data suggest that the course 
of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not different from myocarditis or pericarditis in 
general. 
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. 
Vaccinees should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms 
indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, 
or palpitations following vaccination. 
Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
The risk of myocarditis after a third dose of Comirnaty has not yet been characterised.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis / Pericarditis 
Based on observational studies the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis ranges from 
0.1-1.6 per 10,000 persons, which corresponds to frequency category Very Rare (< 1 per 
10,000). The incidence of myocarditis in younger males was at the high end of the range 
and corresponds to the frequency category Rare (≥1/10.000, <1/1.000). 
The Patient Information Leaflet should be amended accordingly: 
Section 2 
Very rare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the 
lining outside the heart) have been reported after vaccination with Comirnaty. The cases have 
primarily occurred within two weeks following vaccination, more often after the second vaccination, 
and more often occurred in younger men males. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of 
myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate 
medical attention should these occur.

3.8.  Comments from other PRAC members and MAH(s)  
Full endorsement without addition comments were received by: Member State (MS)1, MS2 
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: The endorsements are noted. 
MS3 
The PRAC Rapps AR is endorsed. However, we have two additional comments:  
According to the MAH, four cases of myocarditis and pericarditis were reported in the pivotal clinical 
trial (2 in placebo and 2 in vaccine arm). Two of the cases were reported in subjects who originally 
received placebo, but developed myocarditis/pericarditis after receiving two doses of Comirnaty 
(crossover), and the third case were reported in a subject randomized to receive Comirnaty.  
Therefore, the correct number of cases of myocarditis/pericarditis reported from clinical trials is 3 in 
the active group and 1 in the placebo group. The AR should be amended accordingly.  
The MAH provided a cumulative review of relevant data, and included a medically confirmed case of 
myocarditis involving a patient who experienced myocarditis, leading to hospitalization 4 days after 
dose 2, with an unknown clinical outcome. This case is not consistent with earlier observations of 
myocarditis, and in view of the recent approval of Comirnaty for children aged 5 to 11 years, additional 
data on the outcome of this case is expected. 
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
The additional comments/ corrections are acknowledged. 
MS4 
The PRAC Rapporteur's AR is generally endorsed. However, MS4 has some additional comments. 
Based on the vast amount of data available, the proposal to update the current frequency (unknown) is 
fully supported.  
We would however like to highlight that multiple studies showed an increased risk of myocarditis for 
Spikevax as compared to Comirnaty. The observational studies, which the proposed update for 
Comirnaty is based on, did not include risk estimates for Spikevax, and hence a direct comparison is 
not possible.  
Based on the data available for Spikevax, in the signal AR for Spikevax, we propose an update of the 
frequency to “very rare” for myocarditis with an addition to highlight that the risk is higher in younger 
men (frequency “rare”). This results in the same frequency categories for Spikevax and Comirnaty, 
despite the robust data from multiple sources indicating an increased risk for Spikevax vs Comirnaty.  
Therefore, we propose to reflect a frequency based on the same data for the Comirnaty and the 
Spikevax. Based on the lower exposure for Spikevax (i.e. less studies estimating the risk), we consider 
that the Nordic cohort study (Karlstad et al., 2021) provides robust estimates allowing an estimation of 
frequency for both the Comirnaty and the Spikevax.   
Signal assessment report on Myocarditis, pericarditis with Tozinameran (COVID-19 
mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified) – COMIRNATY)  
EMA/751066/2021  
Page 68/83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
In the Nordic cohort study (Karlstad et al., 2021), following the second dose of Spikevax, in males 16-
24 years, the excess number of cases of myocarditis was 18.8 (95% CI 9.56 – 28.04) per 100,000 
doses. As no absolute numbers (cases per doses) were provided we propose to use the excess cases 
estimates to provide a frequency. For Spikevax, this would result in a frequency of approximately 1.9/ 
10,000 (rare) for males in this age stratum. For Comirnaty, the excess number of cases of myocarditis 
was 5.69 (95% CI 3.87 – 7.52) per 100,000 vaccinated, which would result in a frequency of 
approximately 0.7/10,000 (very rare). Referring to the same data would allow to highlight the possible 
differences in the risk between the two mRNA vaccines.  
Therefore, MS4 proposes the below amendments to the SmPC [for Comirnaty]. 
Section 4.8 Side effects  
Cardiac disorders 
[Frequency] Not known Very rare: myocarditisd, pericarditisd  
Description of selected adverse reactions  
Myocarditis / Pericarditis 
Based on observational studies the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis ranges from 
0.1-1.6 per 10,000 persons, which corresponds to frequency category Very Rare (< 1 per 
10,000). The incidence of myocarditis in younger males was at the high end of the range 
and corresponds to the frequency category Rare (≥1/10.000, <1/1.000).  
A Nordic cohort study of 23.1 million individuals from DK, FI, NO and SE estimated the 
excess number of cases of myocarditis to 5.69 (95% CI 3.87 – 7.52) per 100,000 vaccinated 
for males 16 – 24 years old. Although the risk is higher in younger males (See section 4.4), 
the frequency remains within the frequency category “Very rare”.  
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
The proposal of MS4 is not endorsed. However in the updated recommendation we have included 
more details including the results from the recent EU studies. Also see MS5 comments. 
It is acknowledged that the possible differences in the height of the risk between the two mRNA 
vaccines that has been observed in several studies is important information to communicate with 
health care professionals, but in our view this cannot be addressed via the SmPC of Comirnaty. We do 
feel that a statement in the product information of Spikevax would be appropriate, e.g. as has been 
included in the FDA prescribing information of Spikevax  
We do not agree to include numbers from the unpublished Nordic study in the product information, as 
this gives an incomplete picture and is prone to updates with more data becoming available. Should 
the PRAC decide to include incidences this should be based on all available data (i.e. EU and non-EU 
studies) 
Generally, comparative statements regarding adverse reaction frequencies comparing different 
products, should be avoided in the SmPC of a particular product. 
For all EU and non-EU observational studies currently available some degree of uncertainty remains 
regarding the impact of unmeasured confounding between the vaccinated and unvaccinated 
populations, let alone between populations that have received different vaccines.

Moreover, the variation in incidence estimates depending on the age, gender, population, particular 
study, even for the same product, renders it very hard to accurately reflect these observed 
differences/trend between products in the SmPC. The fact that the ranges of estimates partially 
overlap between the different vaccines, and the ADR frequency categories used in the SmPC section 
4.8 have wide margins (10-fold steps between categories), makes it very hard to accurately 
representing these observed differences. 
The MS4 proposal to provide as justification (in section 4.8 c description of selected adverse reactions) 
risk estimates as excess number of cases per 100,000 vaccinated persons is, although scientifically 
correct, not endorsed, as frequency category assignment should be based on crude incidence rates, 
as stated the SmPC Guidance. 
[If the choice of the frequency category is based on different sources, the category representing the 
highest frequency should be chosen unless a more specific method has been applied and thus resulted 
in an estimate of clearly higher validity, e.g. a pooled analysis across suitable studies. 
Adverse reactions from clinical trials: 
… 
Frequency should represent crude incidence rates (and not differences or relative risks calculated 
against placebo or other comparator). 
Adverse reactions from safety studies: 
The choice of the frequency category to which any adverse reaction will be assigned is based on the 
point estimate of the crude incidence rate derived from a study designed in such a way that specific 
adverse events occurring in patients within a defined observation period would have been detected and 
reasonably attributed to the medicinal product. In this situation, it is possible to calculate a point 
estimate of the crude incidence rate using standard statistical methods. In cases where the original 
information is expressed as an incidence density (denominator expressed as person-time), an 
appropriate transformation into an incidence proportion should be performed for choosing the 
frequency category. Normally, incidence proportions for the most representative exposure period (e.g. 
1 week, 3 months, 1 year) should be used to derive the frequency category. However, this may not be 
appropriate if the hazard function increases over time; in this case, the adverse reaction and its 
frequency pattern, when clinically relevant, should be properly described in section c). 
The frequency category to be chosen for each adverse reaction should not be based on differences 
calculated against a comparator. However, when data are derived from a study with a non-exposed 
group and the rate difference attributed to the medicinal product is smaller than the baseline or 
background incidence rate, and if the adverse reaction is considered important, the background 
incidence may be provided (e.g. in section c).] 
MS5 
In large, we agree with the assessment by the PRAC rapporteur and the need to update the PI. 
However, we have some additional comments, including a proposal for a more detailed update of the 
PI, given that there currently is a substantially larger data set available than at the time of deciding 
the current wording (See below).

Clinical Safety 
Evaluation of myocarditis and pericarditis cases: 
•  When presenting some of the data, and particularly in summaries, myocarditis and pericarditis 
are lumped together. This is unfortunate, as these are not the same diseases, and e.g. the 
clear sex difference in both natural and vaccine induced occurrence of myocarditis, is not at all 
obvious for pericarditis. Thus, we find it important to analyse these entities separately. 
•  We note that for myocarditis only BC level 1 cases are primarily reviewed. However, for future 
reviews, we find it important that also BC level 2 cases are closely considered in the analysis, 
as cases assessed as BC level 2 add valuable information regarding myocarditis risk after 
vaccination. 
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
Note the entities has been analysed separately and all BC levels are included.  ANNEX 2 of the AR 
contains CUMULATIVE Analysis of the Safety Database (through 28 October 2021) of 
Post-Authorization Reports of Myocarditis and Pericarditis following the Administration of PF-07302048 
(BNT162b2). Tables 12 to 18 list the details of all BC level myocarditis, and Table 19 to 25 the details 
of all BC level pericarditis cases. 
Regarding subsequent outcomes for those developing vaccine induced 
myocarditis/pericarditis: 
We acknowledge that there is a continued lack of knowledge regarding potential underlying 
mechanisms as well as of long-term outcomes of both vaccine induced diseases. Continued work is 
important. 
We note in the conclusion from e.g. the French study, stating: the study confirms the positive clinical 
prognosis for cases of myocarditis and pericarditis arising after vaccination. 
We find it too early to draw such conclusions, particularly considering the so far short follow up time 
analysed. The sentence in the current SmPC: ‘Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis 
and pericarditis following vaccination is not different from myocarditis or pericarditis in general. Is not 
optimal, given the substantial uncertainties regarding long-term consequences, as well as the fact that 
there are some serious cases also observed in the short term. This is a very important issue for further 
follow up. 
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
The comment regarding uncertainty of severity, clinical course and outcome is endorsed, as is already 
reflected in the PRAC Rapporteur’s conclusion: ‘…in a considerable number of cases no information on 
the duration of event, or whether the events were resolved is available. The MAH is expected to keep 
the clinical course, severity, outcome, sequelae under close monitoring in both spontaneous reports 
and ongoing and planned observational studies. The Rapporteur should be notified immediately in case 
of unexpected findings or trends.’ 
At this moment we do not see any grounds to alter the already including statement: Available data 
suggest that the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not different from 
myocarditis or pericarditis in general.

Additional comments 27 November 2021  
We have tried to get an understanding of the studies referred to in the Rapporteur’s proposed 
recommendation (Section 3.7), being the basis for the proposed revision of the ADR frequency in 
section 4.8 and the added text regarding observational studies. In section 3.7, it is stated:  
The PRAC Rap notes that the current frequency category in 4.8 (frequency unknown) does not 
adequately represent the current body of evidence gathered in the post-marketing phase based on 
observational studies. For instance based on the studies cited by the MAH: 
• 
Two studies reported myocarditis and pericarditis frequency following BNT162b2 vaccination 
for all ages combined of 10 (95% CI 6.1-15.4) per million for myocarditis and 18 (95% 
CI 13.-25.5) per million for pericarditis in a US healthcare system,xxxii and 13.5 cases of 
myocarditis and/or pericarditis per million doses in Australia.xxxiii 
• 
Information about myocarditis and perimyocarditis by age has been reported by the Israeli 
Ministry of Health as part of their overall COVID-19 Vaccine monitoring. xxxiv Among males the 
reporting rate of myocarditis was lower for individuals 12 to 15 years of age than for 
individuals 16 to 19 years of age for both dose 1 (1/196,398=0.51 vs 3/261,112=1.15 per 
100,000 doses) and dose 2 (11/158,541=6.94 vs 37/226,452=16.34 per 100,000 doses), 
with rates for both doses declining thereafter with age. 
Based on the currently available combined body of evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing 
observational studies as cited by the MAH the incidence of myocarditis ranged from 0.1 to 1.6 per 
10,000, hence a frequency category Very Rare < 1 per 10,000 in the SmPC section 4.8 would be 
more appropriate. 
In the AR, we have not been able to find a summary of the US (Diaz GA et al. JAMA. 
2021;326(12):1210) or Australian (Pepe S, Gregory AT, Denniss AR. Heart Lung Circ. 
2021;30(10):1425-9) studies referred to in the first bullet point, which appears to be the bases for the 
lower range proposed in the additional text for section 4.8 of the SmPC. The articles were however 
submitted by the MAH, and some points are worth noting:  
Pepe S, Gregory AT, Denniss AR. Heart Lung Circ. 2021;30(10):1425-9. 
We would not refer to this as a study, is seems more like a review article. Nevertheless, the figure of 
estimated frequency in Australia given in the bullet point above is reflected in the article and seems to 
come from the following paragraph: 
 In Australia, to 11 July 2021, the Department of Health Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has 
received 50 reports of suspected myocarditis and/or pericarditis out of 288 total adverse event reports 
after 3.7 million doses of Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccine [32]. These reported cases of temporally 
associated possible myocarditis/ pericarditis and their clinical course are being evaluated and may be 
an overestimate of the incidence; however, if all these events are confirmed as likely vaccination 
complications, this represents an incidence of 13.5 per million doses administered. 
Thus, the reference in bullet 1 to 13.5 cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis per million doses in 
Australia seems based on spontaneously reported data, in relation to the estimation of vaccine doses 
administered. We do not find that an appropriate source for frequency estimation, and propose this 
reference is being removed from discussion supporting the frequencies in the PI.  
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
The comment is endorsed that this paper is more a review of published reporting rates from 
spontaneous reporting sources and should not be used to support frequencies in the PI.

Diaz et al : JAMA. 2021;326(12):1210 
This study was undertaken based on data from forty hospitals in 4 US states that were part of the 
Providence health care system and used the same electronic medical record (EMR). Among 2 000 287 
individuals receiving at least 1 COVID-19 vaccination, 58.9% were women, the median age was 57 
years (interquartile range [IQR], 40-70 years), 76.5% received more than 1 dose, 52.6% received the 
BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech), 44.1% received the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna), and 3.1% 
received the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Janssen/Johnson&Johnson). Twenty individuals had vaccine-
related myocarditis (1.0 [95% CI, 0.61-1.54] per 100 000) and 37 had pericarditis (1.8 [95% CI, 
1.30-2.55] per 100 000).  
The estimation in the last sentence above seems to be a summary of all cases of myocarditis and 
pericarditis respectively, for the three vaccines together, and irrespective of first or second dose. For 
myocarditis, there were 11 cases for Spikevax, 9 cases for Comirnaty and none for the Janssen 
vaccine. For pericarditis, there were 12 cases for Spikevax, 23 (Comirnaty), and 2 (Janssen).  
Thus, the lower range proposed for the PI, for both myocarditis and pericarditis, of 0.1/ 10,000 
persons, seems based on combined data on myocarditis for the two mRNA vaccines. Furthermore, the 
figure stated in the bullet above for pericarditis (0.18 / 10 000 persons), appears based on data for the 
three vaccines combined. This raises two questions on the appropriateness of i) adding data to the 
SmPC based on combined vaccine data, ii) to use the lower range for myocarditis for also pericarditis, 
even if the occurrence of pericarditis was nearly twice as high.  
Further, it is noted that the population included in this study only partly seems presentative for the 
total population approved for Comirnaty as the median age in the study was 57 years (IQR 40-70 
years), and given the clear age-dependent risk for myocarditis particularly. Finally, the total number of 
myocarditis cases following use of Comirnaty in this study (n=9) makes the estimations quite 
uncertain.  
We would have appreciated also including the Nordic and French data sets in the discussion of 
estimation of the absolute risk of myocarditis as well as pericarditis, although it is acknowledged that 
the results from these studies are not presented in the same way and that presentation of excess 
number of cases (as in both of these studies) is not the usual way of estimating frequencies (will 
underestimate the actual frequency). Further, time windows and exposure metrics may also not be 
entirely similar, which makes frequency assessment somewhat challenging. Nevertheless, both of 
these are well conducted studies with large data sets. In relation to the two publications discussed 
above, these studies are considered more robust, and also of more relevance, given that the lower age 
groups, where the risk is largest, are well represented in these materials.  
Even if estimated ranges when considering the Nordic and French data as well in the end will be 
roughly similar as to those proposed already, given the scrutiny this AR will get when published, we 
suggest broadening and focusing on the most robust data when supporting the PI-updates. If 
maintaining reference to e.g. Diaz et al, for the frequency estimation, it would be desirable to present 
and discuss the strengths and limitations of this study as well. Preferably, the revised PI should in such 
case include the age ranges where these data have been obtained.  
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
The comment regarding the paper of Diaz et al. is endorsed. 
The strength of the study is that included hospital data in US from around 2 million persons receiving 
at least 1 COVID-19 vaccination, but it has the limitations as noted above. Within the updated

recommendation we have highlighted the uncertainties of the lower end of the range and included the 
results from the recent EU studies in support of the proposed frequency category. 
Summary of Product Characteristics, Package Leaflet and Labelling 
Section 4.4: 
We note that only minor changes are proposed for the current wording, which is based on the review 
of a limited number of spontaneously reported cases, which were available by the end of June 2021. 
However, at present, the available data have increased substantially since then. For instance, it can 
clearly be concluded that there is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination 
with Comirnaty. The present text is very vague by stating ‘cases have been observed’, which we do not 
find adequate anymore. A revision should be made (see below). 
Further, we suggest revising the wording related to time to onset with some more detail. The reason is 
that, although the current wording ‘within 14 days’ is not incorrect, there is a notable number of cases 
(both among the spontaneously reported, as well as in e.g. the Nordic data), occurring within just a 
few days. Further, we have been informed by HCPs, that they misunderstand the current statement; 
interpreting it as there is little risk after the first 14 days. We therefore propose to revise the wording 
on TTO. See below (proposed addition in bold underlined; wording to be removed – strikethrough): 
Section 4.4 Warnings and Precautions 
Myocarditis and pericarditis 
There is an increased risk for Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed 
following vaccination with Comirnaty. These These conditions cases can develop within just a 
few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days following vaccination. They 
have more often been observed after the second vaccination, and more often in younger men 
males. 
Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not 
different from myocarditis or pericarditis in general. 
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
The MSs helpful suggestions for further refinement of the wording of SmPC Section 4.4 are endorsed. 
Regarding the proposed addition to section 4.8 
We support the MS4 comments regarding the proposed addition of further detail on this issue in 
section 4.8, and to add specifically data from the Nordic study. 
Furthermore, for the first paragraph, we suggest giving some more details regarding the types of 
studies which this evaluation is based on e.g by the following wording (proposed addition in bold, 
underlined): 
Description of selected adverse reactions

10,000). The incidence of myocarditis in younger males was at the high end of the range and 
corresponds to the frequency category Rare (≥1/10.000, <1/1.000). 
Finally, we support considering the MS4 proposal for Spikevax of adding a sentence regarding lack of 
knowledge regarding myo/pericarditis risk in the peadiatric population, although the somewhat 
different situations in terms of approved age ranges need to be taken into account as well. 
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
Also see MS4 comments and updated recommendation. 
The suggested addition regarding the types of studies on which this evaluation is based is endorsed, 
albeit in a slightly more concise wording, as follows: 
Based on observational studies within and outside Europe including nationwide health registers, 
or other electronic health care data sources in various European countries the incidence of 
myocarditis and pericarditis ranges from 0.1-1.6 per 10,000 persons, which corresponds to frequency 
category Very Rare (< 1 per 10,000). The incidence of myocarditis in younger males was at the high 
end of the range and corresponds to the frequency category Rare (≥1/10.000, <1/1.000). 
Addition of a statement regarding lack of knowledge regarding myo/pericarditis risk in the peadiatric 
population below 12 years-of-age, is not supported. 
MS6 
Please find below some comments for both Signal pARs regarding mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and 
myo/pericarditis signal: 
•  We concur with the Rapporteur regarding not to include data from Nordic registry. An overall 
estimate or an interval estimated with all available data would be fine for us. 
•  Regarding wording for 4.4, we would support MS4 proposal. There are many uncertainties 
regarding children administration and we consider it is important this should be reflected in the 
SmPC to be known for other stakeholders. 
Comment PRAC Rapporteur: 
The comments of endorsment are noted.

3.9.  Updated rapporteur's proposed recommendation  
Based on review of the submitted data the benefit-risk balance remains unchanged. 
Nevertheless, the MAH should adequately address the following: 
Regarding ADR frequency in SmPC 4.8 
The PRAC Rapporteur considers that the current frequency assignment Not known is not accepted. 
The PRAC Rap notes that the current frequency category in 4.8 (frequency unknown) does not 
adequately represent the current body of evidence gathered in the post-marketing phase based on 
observational studies including nationwide health registers, or other electronic health care data 
sources in various non-European and European countries. 
For instance based on the studies and literature (including reviews from spontaneous reporting 
systems) cited by the MAH the lowest and highest estimates were: 
•  A study by Diaz et al. conducted on data from 40 US hospitals including 2 million person who 
receiving at least 1 COVID-19 vaccination, 58.9% were women, the median age was 57 years 
(interquartile range [IQR], 40-70 years), 76.5% received more than 1 dose, 52.6% received 
the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech), 44.1% received the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna), 
and 3.1% received the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Janssen/Johnson&Johnson) reported myocarditis 
and pericarditis frequency following BNT162b2 vaccination for all ages combined of 0.10 (95% 
CI 0.061-0.154) per 10,000 for myocarditis and 0.18 (95% CI 0.13-0.255) per 10.000 for 
pericarditis in a US healthcare system,xxxvHowever these are very rough estimates and have 
limitations as they are based on data for the three vaccines together, and irrespective of first 
or second dose. For myocarditis, there were 11 cases for Spikevax, 9 cases for Comirnaty and 
none for the Janssen vaccine. For pericarditis, there were 12 cases for Spikevax, 23 
(Comirnaty), and 2 (Janssen). Further, it is noted that the population included in this study 
only partly seems representative for the total population approved for Comirnaty as the 
median age in the study was 57 years (IQR 40-70 years), and given the clear age-dependent 
risk for myocarditis particularly. Finally, the total number of myocarditis cases following use of 
Comirnaty in this study (n=9) makes the estimations quite uncertain. 
• 
Information about myocarditis and perimyocarditis by age has been reported by the Israeli 
Ministry of Health as part of their overall COVID-19 Vaccine monitoring (proactive). xxxvi Among 
males the reporting rate of myocarditis was lower for individuals 12 to 15 years of age than for 
individuals 16 to 19 years of age for both dose 1 (1/196,398=0.051 vs 3/261,112=0.115 per 
10,000 doses) and dose 2 (11/158,541=0.0694 vs 37/226,452=1.634 per 10,000 doses), 
with rates for both doses declining thereafter with age. 
The Nordic cohort study of 23.1 million individuals from DK, FI, NO and SE by Karlstadt et al. 
confirmed a higher risk after a second dose of Comirnaty and a higher risk in young men. Excess 
events within 28 days in young males of 0.57 [95% CI 0.39 – 0.75] per 10,000 after a second-
dose vaccination with BNT162b2. Among females 16–24 years, the excess number of events per 
10,000 vaccinated in the 28-day risk periods following first and second doses were 0.02 (95%CI, 0.01 
to 0.05) and 0.05 (95%CI, 0.00 to 0.10) for BNT162b2.  
The EPI-PHARE matched case-control study based on data from the French national health data 
system (SNDS) concluded that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine appears to be associated with an increased 
risk of myocarditis among men under the age of 30 (OR 10.9 [7.6-15.8] and 0.265 [95% CI 0.255-
Signal assessment report on Myocarditis, pericarditis with Tozinameran (COVID-19

0.275] excess cases per 10,000 doses within 7 days following the second dose). Although the 
incidence of myocarditis is lower than it is among men, this risk also increases among young women 
below the age of 30 within 7 days following the second dose (OR 11.4 [4.5-28.6] and 0.043 [95% CI 
0.037 – 0.045] excess cases per 10,000 doses for Pfizer-BioNTech). 
The results from these recent EU studies are presented as excess number of cases which will 
underestimate the actual frequency. Further, time windows [28 vs 7 days] and exposure metrics may 
also not be entirely similar, which makes frequency assessment somewhat challenging. Nevertheless, 
both of these are well conducted studies with large data sets. In relation to some of the publications 
cited by the MAH, these studies are considered robust, and also of more relevance, given that the 
lower age groups, where the risk is largest, are well represented in these materials. 
The VAC4EU retrospective, multi-database, cohort study, conducted during the study period ranging 
from December 1, 2020 observed the highest excess incidence rates [per person-years] of 
myocarditis or pericarditis as background post-vaccination in persons without COVID19: 
ARS Tuscany: in males 18-24yrs: 121 per 100,000 person-years; in females 30-39yrs: 48 per 100,000 
person-years 
BIFAP PCHOSP: in males 18-24yrs: 152 per 100,000 person-years; in females 40-49yrs: 22 per 
100,000 person-years 
BIFAP PC-COVID: In males 12-17yrs: 49 per 100,000 person-years; in females 12-17yrs: 32 per 
100,000 person-years. 
The results from the VAC4EU study are shown here, but as the excess incidence rates are presented 
per person-years they are not readily compatible with the other EU studies, or ADR frequency category 
in the SmPC. 
Based on the currently available combined body of evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing 
observational studies as cited by the MAH and recent nationwide health registers, or other electronic 
health care data sources in various European countries the incidence of myocarditis ranged from 0.1 
to 1.6 per 10,000, hence a frequency category Very Rare < 1 per 10,000 in the SmPC section 4.8 
would be more appropriate. 
Note that this is would also be more in line with the wording already present in SmPC section 4.4. 
The rationale for the frequency category could be explained in sub-section c “Description of selected 
adverse reactions”. I.e. a footnote could be considered noting that the incidence of myocarditis in the 
younger males was at the high end of the range and would be closer to frequency category rare 
(≥1/10.000, <1/1.000) 
Regarding refinement of SmPC section 4.4 
In addition, the current wording should be further refined. The current product information section 4.4 
mentions: Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed following vaccination 
with Comirnaty. These cases have primarily occurred within 14 days following vaccination, more often 
after the second vaccination, and more often in younger men. 
It is proposed to remove and replace ‘men’ (which implies adults only) by ‘males’, as also cases have 
been observed in adolescent males aged below 18 years. 
Further suggestions of MS are endorsed. See below. 
Request for further adjustment of SmPC section 4.4 when more robust data become available 
Based on the O/E analyses presented by the MAH (Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3) it is noted that 
although the absolute number of cases in males is higher, the background incidence in males is also

mRNA vaccine (nucleoside-modified) – COMIRNATY)

higher. Consequently, the O/E ratios above 1 do not really differ that much between males and 
females. This aspect is currently not reflected in the current wording in SmPC section 4.4. On the other 
hand, the numbers of female cases shown here, but also in the epidemiological studies cited by the 
MAH (as well as those conducted by VAC4EU and EPI-PHARE) are low, especially in the younger 
females, which raises the question regarding robustness of these estimates. 
The MAH should commit to remain closely evaluating the risk estimates in females, and in case more 
(robust, stable) data would become available, provide a proposal for refined/adjusted the wording in 
SmPC section 4.4, as appropriate.  
Characteristics, severity, outcome 
Based on the above reviews of characteristics, severity, duration and outcome of myocarditis and 
pericarditis the current wording in the SmPC section 4.4 regarding disease course is still considered 
adequate. Nevertheless in a considerable number of cases no information on the duration of event, or 
whether the events were resolved is available. The MAH is expected to keep the clinical course, 
severity, outcome, sequelae under close monitoring in both spontaneous reports and ongoing and 
planned observational studies. The Rapporteur should be notified immediately in case of unexpected 
findings or trends.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocarditis 
The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see 
section 4.4). 
Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males 
following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second 
dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year old 
males per 10,000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the 
second dose there were 0.57 [95% CI 0.39 – 0.75] extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males 
per 10,000 compared to unexposed persons.

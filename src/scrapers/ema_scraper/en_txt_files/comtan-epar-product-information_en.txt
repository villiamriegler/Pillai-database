PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Film-coated tablet
Brownish-orange, oval, biconvex film-coated tablet with “Comtan” engraved on one side.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Entacapone is indicated as an adjunct to standard preparations of levodopa/benserazide or 
levodopa/carbidopa for use in adult patients with Parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose motor 
fluctuations, who cannot be stabilised on those combinations.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Entacapone should only be used in combination with levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa. 
The prescribing information for these levodopa preparations is applicable to their concomitant use 
with entacapone.
Posology
One 200 mg tablet is taken with each levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor dose. The maximum 
recommended dose is 200 mg ten times daily, i.e. 2,000 mg of entacapone.
Entacapone enhances the effects of levodopa. Hence, to reduce levodopa-related dopaminergic 
adverse reactions, e.g. dyskinesias, nausea, vomiting and hallucinations, it is often necessary to 
adjust levodopa dosage within the first days to first weeks after initiating entacapone treatment. The 
daily dose of levodopa should be reduced by about 10–30% by extending the dosing intervals and/or 
by reducing the amount of levodopa per dose, according to the clinical condition of the patient.
If entacapone treatment is discontinued, it is necessary to adjust the dosing of other antiparkinsonian 
treatments, especially levodopa, to achieve a sufficient level of control of the parkinsonian 
symptoms.
Entacapone increases the bioavailability of levodopa from standard levodopa/benserazide 
preparations slightly (5–10%) more than from standard levodopa/carbidopa preparations. Hence, 
patients who are taking standard levodopa/benserazide preparations may need a larger reduction of 
levodopa dose when entacapone is initiated.
2
Renal impairment
Renal insufficiency does not affect the pharmacokinetics of entacapone and there is no need for dose 
adjustment. However, for patients who are receiving dialysis therapy, a longer dosing interval may 
be considered (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
See section 4.3.
Elderly (≥65 years)
No dosage adjustment of entacapone is required for older people.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Comtan in children below age 18 have not been established. No data are 
available.
Method of administration
Entacapone is administered orally and simultaneously with each levodopa/carbidopa or 
levodopa/benserazide dose.
Entacapone can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2).
4.3 Contraindications
-
-
-
-
-
-
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Hepatic impairment.
Phaeochromocytoma.
Concomitant use of entacapone and non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO-A and MAO-B) 
inhibitors (e.g. phenelzine, tranylcypromine).
Concomitant use of a selective MAO-A inhibitor plus a selective MAO-B inhibitor and 
entacapone (see section 4.5).
A previous history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and/or non-traumatic 
rhabdomyolysis.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Rhabdomyolysis secondary to severe dyskinesias or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been 
observed rarely in patients with Parkinson’s disease.
NMS, including rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia, is characterised by motor symptoms (rigidity, 
myoclonus, tremor), mental status changes (e.g. agitation, confusion, coma), hyperthermia, autonomic 
dysfunction (tachycardia, labile blood pressure) and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase. In 
individual cases, only some of these symptoms and/or findings may be evident.
Neither NMS nor rhabdomyolysis have been reported in association with entacapone treatment from 
controlled trials in which entacapone was discontinued abruptly. Since the introduction into the 
market, isolated cases of NMS have been reported, especially following abrupt reduction or 
discontinuation of entacapone and other concomitant dopaminergic medicinal products. When 
considered necessary, withdrawal of entacapone and other dopaminergic treatment should proceed 
slowly, and if signs and/or symptoms occur despite a slow withdrawal of entacapone, an increase in 
levodopa dosage may be necessary.
Entacapone therapy should be administered cautiously to patients with ischaemic heart disease.
Because of its mechanism of action, entacapone may interfere with the metabolism of medicinal
3
products containing a catechol group and potentiate their action. Thus, entacapone should be 
administered cautiously to patients being treated with medicinal products metabolised by catechol-O-
methyl transferase (COMT), e.g. rimiterole, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, 
dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, and apomorphine (see also section 4.5).
Entacapone is always given as an adjunct to levodopa treatment. Hence, the precautions valid for 
levodopa treatment should also be taken into account for entacapone treatment. Entacapone increases 
the bioavailability of levodopa from standard levodopa/benserazide preparations 5–10% more than 
from standard levodopa/carbidopa preparations. Consequently, adverse dopaminergic reactions may 
be more frequent when entacapone is added to levodopa/benserazide treatment (see also section 4.8). 
To reduce levodopa-related dopaminergic adverse reactions, it is often necessary to adjust levodopa 
dosage within the first days to first weeks after initiating entacapone treatment, according to the 
clinical condition of the patient (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
Entacapone may aggravate levodopa-induced orthostatic hypotension. Entacapone should be given 
cautiously to patients who are taking other medicinal products which may cause orthostatic 
hypotension.
In clinical studies, undesirable dopaminergic effects, e.g. dyskinesia, were more common in patients 
who received entacapone and dopamine agonists (such as bromocriptine), selegiline or amantadine 
compared to those who received placebo with this combination. The doses of other antiparkinsonian 
medicinal products may need to be adjusted when entacapone treatment is initiated.
Entacapone in association with levodopa has been associated with somnolence and episodes of 
sudden sleep onset in patients with Parkinson’s disease and caution should therefore be exercised 
when driving or operating machines (see also section 4.7).
For patients experiencing diarrhoea, a follow-up of weight is recommended in order to avoid 
potential excessive weight decrease. Prolonged or persistent diarrhoea appearing during use of
entacapone may be a sign of colitis. In the event of prolonged or persistent diarrhoea, the medicinal 
product should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy and investigations considered.
Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients 
and carers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including 
pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge 
eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other 
dopaminergic treatments such as Comtan in association with levodopa. Review of treatment is 
recommended if such symptoms develop.
For patients who experience progressive anorexia, asthenia and weight decrease within a relatively 
short period of time, a general medical evaluation including liver function should be considered.
Comtan tablets contain sucrose. Therefore, patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose 
intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this 
medicine.
This medicinal product contains 7.3 mg sodium per tablet. The maximum recommended daily dose 
(10 tablets) contains 73 mg sodium, equivalent to 4% of the WHO recommended maximum daily 
intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction of entacapone with carbidopa has been observed with the recommended treatment 
schedule. Pharmacokinetic interaction with benserazide has not been studied.
In single-dose studies in healthy volunteers, no interactions were observed between entacapone and 
4
imipramine or between entacapone and moclobemide. Similarly, no interactions between entacapone
and selegiline were observed in repeated-dose studies in parkinsonian patients. However, the 
experience of the clinical use of entacapone with several medicinal products, including MAO-A 
inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors such as desipramine, 
maprotiline and venlafaxine, and medicinal products that are metabolised by COMT (e.g. catechol-
structured compounds: rimiterol, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine, 
alpha-methyldopa, apomorphine, and paroxetine) is still limited. Caution should be exercised when 
these medicinal products are used concomitantly with entacapone (see also sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Entacapone may be used with selegiline (a selective MAO-B inhibitor), but the daily dose of 
selegiline should not exceed 10 mg.
Entacapone may form chelates with iron in the gastrointestinal tract. Entacapone and iron 
preparations should be taken at least 2–3 hours apart (see section 4.8).
Entacapone binds to human albumin binding site II which also binds several other medicinal 
products, including diazepam and ibuprofen. Clinical interaction studies with diazepam and non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products have not been carried out. According to in vitro
studies, significant displacement is not anticipated at therapeutic concentrations of the medicinal 
products.
Due to its affinity to cytochrome P450 2C9 in vitro (see section 5.2), entacapone may potentially 
interfere with medicinal products with metabolism dependent on this isoenzyme, such as S-warfarin. 
However, in an interaction study in healthy volunteers, entacapone did not change the plasma levels 
of S-warfarin, while the AUC for R-warfarin increased on average by 18% [CI90 11–26%]. The INR 
values increased on average by 13% [CI90 6–19%]. Thus, control of INR is recommended when 
entacapone treatment is initiated for patients receiving warfarin.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
No overt teratogenic or primary foetotoxic effects were observed in animal studies in which the 
exposure levels of entacapone were markedly higher than the therapeutic exposure levels. As there is 
no experience in pregnant women, entacapone should not be used during pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
In animal studies entacapone was excreted in milk. The safety of entacapone in infants is unknown. 
Women should not breast-feed during treatment with entacapone.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Comtan in association with levodopa may have a major influence on the ability to drive and use 
machines. Entacapone may, together with levodopa, cause dizziness and symptomatic orthostatism. 
Therefore, caution should be exercised when driving or using machines.
Patients being treated with entacapone in association with levodopa and presenting with somnolence 
and/or sudden sleep onset episodes must be instructed to refrain from driving or engaging in 
activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death 
(e.g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes have resolved (see also section 4.4).
5
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most frequent adverse reactions caused by entacapone relate to the increased dopaminergic 
activity and occur most commonly at the beginning of treatment. Reduction of levodopa dosage 
decreases the severity and frequency of these reactions. The other major class of adverse reactions 
are gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation and 
diarrhoea. Urine may be discoloured reddish-brown by entacapone, but this is a harmless 
phenomenon.
Usually the adverse reactions caused by entacapone are mild to moderate. In clinical studies the most 
common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of entacapone treatment have been 
gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. diarrhoea, 2.5%) and increased dopaminergic adverse reactions of 
levodopa (e.g. dyskinesias, 1.7%).
Dyskinesias (27%), nausea (11%), diarrhoea (8%), abdominal pain (7%) and dry mouth (4.2%) were 
reported significantly more often with entacapone than with placebo in pooled data from clinical 
studies involving 406 patients taking the medicinal product and 296 patients taking placebo.
Some of the adverse reactions, such as dyskinesia, nausea, and abdominal pain, may be more 
common with the higher doses (1,400 to 2,000 mg per day) than with the lower doses of entacapone.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The following adverse reactions, listed below in Table 1, have been accumulated both from clinical 
studies with entacapone and since the introduction of entacapone into the market.

Adverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency, the most frequent first, using the 
following convention: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon 
(≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot 
be estimated from the available data, since no valid estimate can be derived from clinical trials 
or epidemiological studies).
The incidence rates of myocardial infarction and other ischaemic heart disease events (0.43% 
and 1.54%, respectively) are derived from an analysis of 13 double-blind studies involving 
2,082 patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations receiving entacapone.
Description of selected adverse reactions
Entacapone in association with levodopa has been associated with isolated cases of excessive 
daytime somnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes.
Impulse control disorders: Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive 
spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine 
agonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments such as Comtan in association with levodopa (see 
section 4.4).
Isolated cases of NMS have been reported following abrupt reduction or discontinuation of 
entacapone and other dopaminergic treatments.
Isolated cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
The post-marketing data include isolated cases of overdose in which the reported highest daily dose of 
entacapone has been 16,000 mg. The acute symptoms and signs in these cases of overdose included 
confusion, decreased activity, somnolence, hypotonia, skin discolouration and urticaria. Management 
of acute overdose is symptomatic.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: other dopaminergic agents, ATC code: N04BX02.
Entacapone belongs to a new therapeutic class, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors. It 
is a reversible, specific, and mainly peripherally acting COMT inhibitor designed for concomitant 
administration with levodopa preparations. Entacapone decreases the metabolic loss of levodopa to 
3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) by inhibiting the COMT enzyme. This leads to a higher levodopa AUC. 
The amount of levodopa available to the brain is increased. Entacapone thus prolongs the clinical 
response to levodopa.
7
Entacapone inhibits the COMT enzyme mainly in peripheral tissues. COMT inhibition in red blood 
cells closely follows the plasma concentrations of entacapone, thus clearly indicating the reversible 
nature of COMT inhibition.
Clinical studies
In two phase III double-blind studies in a total of 376 patients with Parkinson’s disease and end-of-
dose motor fluctuations, entacapone or placebo was given with each levodopa/dopa decarboxylase 
inhibitor dose. The results are given in Table 2. In study I, daily ON time (hours) was measured from 
home diaries and in study II, the proportion of daily ON time.

5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
General characteristics of the active substance
Absorption
There are large intra- and interindividual variations in the absorption of entacapone.
The peak concentration (Cmax) in plasma is usually reached about one hour after ingestion of a 
200 mg entacapone tablet. The substance is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism. The 
bioavailability of entacapone is about 35% after an oral dose. Food does not affect the absorption of 
entacapone to any significant extent.
Distribution
After absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, entacapone is rapidly distributed to the peripheral 
tissues with a distribution volume of 20 litres at steady state (Vdss). Approximately 92% of the dose 
is eliminated during ß-phase with a short elimination half-life of 30 minutes. The total clearance of 
entacapone is about 800 ml/min.
Entacapone is extensively bound to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin. In human plasma the 
unbound fraction is about 2.0% in the therapeutic concentration range. At therapeutic concentrations, 
entacapone does not displace other extensively bound substances (e.g. warfarin, salicylic acid, 
phenylbutazone, or diazepam), nor is it displaced to any significant extent by any of these substances
at therapeutic or higher concentrations.
8
Biotransformation
A small amount of entacapone, the (E)-isomer, is converted to its (Z)-isomer. The (E)-isomer 
accounts for 95% of the AUC of entacapone. The (Z)-isomer and traces of other metabolites account 
for the remaining 5%.
Data from in vitro studies using human liver microsomal preparations indicate that entacapone 
inhibits cytochrome P450 2C9 (IC50 4 µM). Entacapone showed little or no inhibition of other types 
of P450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A and CYP2C19) (see section 
4.5).
Elimination
The elimination of entacapone occurs mainly by non-renal metabolic routes. It is estimated that 80–
90% of the dose is excreted in faeces, although this has not been confirmed in man. Approximately 
10–20% is excreted in urine. Only traces of entacapone are found unchanged in urine. The major part 
(95%) of the product excreted in urine is conjugated with glucuronic acid. Of the metabolites found 
in urine only about 1% have been formed through oxidation.
Characteristics in patients
The pharmacokinetic properties of entacapone are similar in both young people and older people. 
The metabolism of the medicinal product is slowed in patients with mild to moderate liver 
insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class A and B), which leads to an increased plasma concentration of 
entacapone in both the absorption and elimination phases (see section 4.3). Renal impairment does 
not affect the pharmacokinetics of entacapone. However, a longer dosing interval may be considered 
for patients who are receiving dialysis therapy.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. In repeated dose 
toxicity studies, anaemia most likely due to iron chelating properties of entacapone was observed. 
Regarding reproduction toxicity, decreased foetal weight and a slightly delayed bone development 
were noticed in rabbits at systemic exposure levels in the therapeutic range.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Comtan is and what it is used for
Comtan tablets contain entacapone and are used together with levodopa to treat Parkinson’s disease. 
Comtan aids levodopa in relieving the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Comtan has no effect on 
relieving the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease unless taken with levodopa.
2. What you need to know before you take Comtan
Do not take Comtan

if you are allergic to entacapone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6);
if you have a tumour of the adrenal gland (known as pheochromocytoma; this may increase the 
risk of severe high blood pressure);
if you are taking certain antidepressants (ask your doctor or pharmacist whether your 
antidepressive medicine can be taken together with Comtan);
if you have liver disease;
if you have ever suffered from a rare reaction to antipsychotic medicines called neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome (NMS). See Section 4 Possible side effects for the characteristics of 
NMS;
if you have ever suffered from a rare muscle disorder called rhabdomyolysis which was not 
caused by injury.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Comtan:


if you have ever had a heart attack or any other diseases of the heart;
if you are taking a medicine which may cause dizziness or light-headedness (low blood 
pressure) when rising from a chair or bed;
if you experience prolonged diarrhoea consult your doctor as it may be a sign of inflammation 
of the colon;
if you experience diarrhoea, monitoring of your weight is recommended in order to avoid 





potentially excessive weight loss;
if you experience increasing loss of appetite, weakness, exhaustion and weight loss within a 
relatively short period of time, a general medical evaluation including liver function should be 
considered.
Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices you are developing urges or cravings to behave in 
ways that are unusual for you or you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry out certain 
activities that could harm yourself or others. These behaviours are called impulse control disorders 
and can include addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high sex drive or a 
preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to review your 
treatments.
As Comtan tablets will be taken together with other levodopa medicines, please also read the package 
leaflets of these medicines carefully.
The dose of other medicines to treat Parkinson’s disease may need to be adjusted when you start 
taking Comtan. Follow the instructions that your doctor has given you.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is a serious but rare reaction to certain medicines, and may 
occur especially when Comtan and other medicines to treat Parkinson’s disease are suddenly stopped 
or the dose is suddenly reduced. For the characteristics of NMS see Section 4 Possible side effects. 
Your doctor may advise you to slowly discontinue the treatment with Comtan and other medicines to 
treat Parkinson’s disease.
Comtan taken with levodopa may cause drowsiness and may cause you to sometimes suddenly fall 
asleep. If this happens, you should not drive or use any tools or machines (see “Driving and using 
machines”).

apomorphine;
antidepressants including desipramine, maprotiline, venlafaxine, paroxetine;

suddenly fall asleep.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for insulin glargine / lixisenatide, 
the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on delayed gastric emptying from spontaneous reports including a case with 
close temporal relationship and a positive de-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action 
for all GLP 1 RA products, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between lixisenatide and delayed 
gastric emptying is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information 
of products containing insulin glargine/ lixisenatide should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for insulin glargine / lixisenatide the CHMP is of the opinion 
that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing insulin glargine / lixisenatide is 
unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Ferriprox monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassaemia 
major when current chelation therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. 
Ferriprox in combination with another chelator (see section 4.4) is indicated in patients with 
thalassaemia major when monotherapy with any iron chelator is ineffective, or when prevention or 
treatment of life-threatening consequences of iron overload (mainly cardiac overload) justifies rapid or 
intensive correction (see section 4.2). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Deferiprone therapy should be initiated and maintained by a physician experienced in the treatment of 
patients with thalassaemia.

Posology 
Deferiprone is usually given as 25 mg/kg body weight, orally, three times a day for a total daily dose 
of 75 mg/kg body weight. Dose per kilogram body weight should be calculated to the nearest half 
tablet. See tables below for recommended doses for body weights at 10 kg increments. 
To obtain a dose of about 75 mg/kg/day, use the number of tablets suggested in the following tables 
for the body weight of the patient. Sample body weights at 10 kg increments are listed.

A total daily dose above 100 mg/kg body weight is not recommended because of the potentially 
increased risk of adverse reactions (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 4.9). 
Dose adjustment 
The effect of Ferriprox in decreasing the body iron is directly influenced by the dose and the degree of 
iron overload. After starting Ferriprox therapy, it is recommended that serum ferritin concentrations, 
or other indicators of body iron load, be monitored every two to three months to assess the long-term 
effectiveness of the chelation regimen in controlling the body iron load. Dose adjustments should be 
tailored to the individual patient’s response and therapeutic goals (maintenance or reduction of body 
iron burden). Interruption of therapy with deferiprone should be considered if serum ferritin falls 
below 500 µg/l. 
Dose adjustments when used with other iron chelators 
In patients for whom monotherapy is inadequate, Ferriprox may be used with deferoxamine at the 
standard dose (75 mg/kg/day) but should not exceed 100 mg/kg/day. 
In the case of iron-induced heart failure, Ferriprox at 75-100 mg/kg/day should be added to 
deferoxamine therapy. The product information of deferoxamine should be consulted. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concurrent use of iron chelators is not recommended in patients whose serum ferritin falls below 
500 µg/l due to the risk of excessive iron removal. 
Renal impairment 
Dose adjustment is not required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (see 
section 5.2). The safety and pharmacokinetics of Ferriprox in patients with end stage renal disease are 
unknown. 
Hepatic impairment 
Dose adjustment is not required in patients with mildly or moderately impaired hepatic function (see 
section 5.2). The safety and pharmacokinetics of Ferriprox in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
are unknown. 
Paediatric population 
There are limited data available on the use of deferiprone in children between 6 and 10 years of age, 
and no data on deferiprone use in children under 6 years of age. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
4.3  Contraindications 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
History of recurrent episodes of neutropenia. 
History of agranulocytosis. 
Pregnancy (see section 4.6). 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
Due to the unknown mechanism of deferiprone-induced neutropenia, patients must not take 
medicinal products known to be associated with neutropenia or those that can cause 
agranulocytosis (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis 
Deferiprone has been shown to cause neutropenia, including agranulocytosis (see section 4.8 
‘Description of selected adverse reactions’). The patient’s absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 
should be monitored every week during the first year of therapy. For patients whose Ferriprox 
has not been interrupted during the first year of therapy due to any decrease in the neutrophil 
count, the frequency of ANC monitoring may be extended to the patient’s blood transfusion 
interval (every 2-4 weeks) after one year of deferiprone therapy. 
The change from weekly ANC monitoring to monitoring at the time of transfusion visits after 
12 months of Ferriprox therapy, should be considered on an individual patient basis, according to the 
physician’s assessment of the patient’s understanding of the risk minimization measures required 
during therapy (see section 4.4 below). 
In clinical studies, weekly monitoring of the neutrophil count has been effective in identifying cases of 
neutropenia and agranulocytosis. Agranulocytosis and neutropenia usually resolve upon 
discontinuation of Ferriprox, but fatal cases of agranulocytosis have been reported. If the patient 
develops an infection while on deferiprone, therapy should be immediately interrupted, and an ANC 
obtained without delay. The neutrophil count should be then monitored more frequently. 
Patients should be aware to contact their physician if they experience any symptoms indicative 
of infection (such as fever, sore throat and flu-like symptoms). Immediately interrupt 
deferiprone if the patient experiences infection. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Suggested management of cases of neutropenia is outlined below. It is recommended that such a 
management protocol be in place prior to initiating any patient on deferiprone treatment. 
Treatment with deferiprone should not be initiated if the patient is neutropenic. The risk of 
agranulocytosis and neutropenia is higher if the baseline ANC is less than 1.5x109/l. 
For neutropenia events (ANC < 1.5x109/l and > 0.5x109/l): 
Instruct the patient to immediately discontinue deferiprone and all other medicinal products with a 
potential to cause neutropenia. The patient should be advised to limit contact with other individuals in 
order to reduce the risk of infection. Obtain a complete blood cell (CBC) count, with a white blood 
cell (WBC) count, corrected for the presence of nucleated red blood cells, a neutrophil count, and a 
platelet count immediately upon diagnosing the event and then repeat daily. It is recommended that 
following recovery from neutropenia, weekly CBC, WBC, neutrophil and platelet counts continue to 
be obtained for three consecutive weeks, to ensure that the patient has fully recovered. Should any 
evidence of infection develop concurrently with the neutropenia, the appropriate cultures and 
diagnostic procedures should be performed, and an appropriate therapeutic regimen instituted. 
For agranulocytosis (ANC < 0.5x109/l): 
Follow the guidelines above and administer appropriate therapy such as granulocyte colony 
stimulating factor, beginning the same day that the event is identified; administer daily until the 
condition resolves. Provide protective isolation and if clinically indicated, admit patient to the hospital. 
Limited information is available regarding rechallenge. Therefore, in the event of neutropenia, 
rechallenge is not recommended. In the event of agranulocytosis, rechallenge is contraindicated. 
Carcinogenicity/mutagenicity 
In view of the genotoxicity results, a carcinogenic potential of deferiprone cannot be excluded (see 
section 5.3). 
Plasma zinc (Zn2+) concentration 
Monitoring of plasma Zn2+ concentration, and supplementation in case of a deficiency, is 
recommended. 
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive or other immunocompromised patients 
No data are available on the use of deferiprone in HIV positive or in other immunocompromised 
patients. Given that deferiprone can be associated with neutropenia and agranulocytosis, therapy in 
immunocompromised patients should not be initiated unless potential benefits outweigh potential 
risks. 
Renal or hepatic impairment and liver fibrosis 
There are no data available on the use of deferiprone in patients with end stage renal disease or severe 
hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). Caution must be exercised in patients with end stage renal 
disease or severe hepatic dysfunction. Renal and hepatic function should be monitored in these patient 
populations during deferiprone therapy. If there is a persistent increase in serum alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), interruption of deferiprone therapy should be considered. 
In thalassaemia patients there is an association between liver fibrosis and iron overload and/or 
hepatitis C. Special care must be taken to ensure that iron chelation in patients with hepatitis C is 
optimal. In these patients careful monitoring of liver histology is recommended.

Discolouration of urine 
Patients should be informed that their urine may show a reddish/brown discolouration due to the 
excretion of the iron-deferiprone complex. 
Neurological disorders 
Neurological disorders have been observed in children treated with more than 2.5 times the maximum 
recommended dose for several years but have also been observed with standard doses of deferiprone. 
Prescribers are reminded that the use of doses above 100 mg/kg/day are not recommended. 
Deferiprone use should be discontinued if neurological disorders are observed (see sections 4.8 and 
4.9). 
Combined use with other iron chelators 
The use of combination therapy should be considered on a case-by-case basis. The response to therapy 
should be assessed periodically, and the occurrence of adverse events closely monitored. Fatalities and 
life-threatening situations (caused by agranulocytosis) have been reported with deferiprone in 
combination with deferoxamine. Combination therapy with deferoxamine is not recommended when 
monotherapy with either chelator is adequate or when serum ferritin falls below 500 µg/l. Limited data 
are available on the combined use of Ferriprox and deferasirox, and caution should be applied when 
considering the use of such combination. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Due to the unknown mechanism of deferiprone-induced neutropenia, patients must not take medicinal 
products known to be associated with neutropenia or those that can cause agranulocytosis (see 
section 4.3). 
Since deferiprone binds to metallic cations, the potential exists for interactions between deferiprone 
and trivalent cation-dependent medicinal products such as aluminium-based antacids. Therefore, it is 
not recommended to concomitantly ingest aluminium-based antacids and deferiprone. 
The safety of concurrent use of deferiprone and vitamin C has not been formally studied. Based on the 
reported adverse interaction that can occur between deferoxamine and vitamin C, caution should be 
used when administering deferiprone and vitamin C concurrently. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/contraception in men and women 
Due to the genotoxic potential of deferiprone (see section 5.3), women of childbearing potential are 
recommended to use effective contraceptive measures and avoid becoming pregnant while being 
treated with Ferriprox and for 6 months following the completion of treatment. 
Men are recommended to use effective contraceptive measures and to not father a child while 
receiving Ferriprox and for 3 months following completion of treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of deferiprone in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Pregnant women must be advised to immediately stop taking deferiprone (see section 4.3).

Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether deferiprone is excreted in human milk. No prenatal and postnatal reproductive 
studies have been conducted in animals. Deferiprone must not be used by breast-feeding mothers. If 
treatment is unavoidable, breast-feeding must be stopped (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
No effects on fertility or early embryonic development were noted in animals (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Not relevant. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions reported during therapy with deferiprone in clinical studies were 
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and chromaturia, which were reported in more than 10% of 
patients. The most serious adverse reaction reported in clinical studies with deferiprone was 
agranulocytosis, defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 0.5x109/l, which occurred in 
approximately 1% of patients. Less severe episodes of neutropenia were reported in approximately 5% 
of patients.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
The most serious adverse reaction reported in clinical studies with deferiprone is agranulocytosis 
(neutrophils < 0.5x109/l), with an incidence of 1.1% (0.6 cases per 100 patient-years of treatment) (see 
section 4.4). Data from pooled clinical studies in patients with systemic iron overload showed that 
63% of the episodes of agranulocytosis occurred within the first six months of treatment, 74% within 
the first year and 26% after one year of therapy. The median time to onset of the first episode of 
agranulocytosis was 190 days (ranged 22 days- 17.6 years) and median duration was 10 days in 
clinical studies. A fatal outcome was observed in 8.3% of the reported episodes of agranulocytosis 
from clinical studies and post-marketing experience. 
The observed incidence of the less severe form of neutropenia (neutrophils < 1.5x109/l) is 4.9% 
(2.5 cases per 100 patient-years). This rate should be considered in the context of the underlying 
elevated incidence of neutropenia in thalassaemia patients, particularly in those with hypersplenism. 
Episodes of diarrhoea, mostly mild and transient, have been reported in patients treated with 
deferiprone. Gastrointestinal effects are more frequent at the beginning of therapy and resolve in most 
patients within a few weeks without the discontinuation of treatment. In some patients it may be 
beneficial to reduce the dose of deferiprone and then scale it back up to the former dose. Arthropathy 
events, which ranged from mild pain in one or more joints to severe arthritis with effusion and 
significant disability, have also been reported in patients treated with deferiprone. Mild arthropathies 
are generally transient. 
Increased levels of serum liver enzymes have been reported in some patients taking deferiprone. In the 
majority of these patients, the increase was asymptomatic and transient, and returned to baseline 
without discontinuation or decreasing the dose of deferiprone (see section 4.4). 
Some patients experienced progression of fibrosis associated with an increase in iron overload or 
hepatitis C. 
Low plasma zinc levels have been associated with deferiprone in a minority of patients. The levels 
normalised with oral zinc supplementation. 
Neurological disorders (such as cerebellar symptoms, diplopia, lateral nystagmus, psychomotor 
slowdown, hand movements and axial hypotonia) have been observed in children who had been 
voluntarily prescribed more than 2.5 times the maximum recommended dose of 100 mg/kg/day for 
several years. Episodes of hypotonia, instability, inability to walk, and hypertonia with inability of 
limb movement, have been reported in children in the post-marketing setting with standard doses of 
deferiprone. The neurological disorders progressively regressed after deferiprone discontinuation (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.9). 
The safety profile of combination therapy (deferiprone and deferoxamine) observed in clinical studies, 
post-marketing experience or published literature was consistent with that characterised for 
monotherapy. 
Data from the pooled safety database from clinical studies (1 343 patient-years exposure to Ferriprox 
monotherapy and 244 patient-years exposure to Ferriprox and deferoxamine) showed statistically 
significant (p < 0.05) differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on System Organ Class 
for “Cardiac disorders", "Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders” and "Renal and urinary 
disorders". The incidences of “Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders” and "Renal and 
urinary disorders" were lower during combination therapy than monotherapy, whereas the incidence of 
“Cardiac disorders" was higher during combination therapy than monotherapy. The higher rate of 
“Cardiac disorders" reported during combination therapy than monotherapy was possibly due to the 
higher incidence of pre-existing cardiac disorders in patients who received combination therapy. 
Careful monitoring of cardiac events in patients on combination therapy is warranted (see section 4.4). 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The incidences of adverse reactions experienced by 18 children and 97 adults treated with combination 
therapy were not significantly different between the two age groups except in the incidence of 
arthropathy (11.1% in children vs. none in adults, p=0.02). Evaluation of rate of reactions per 
100 patient-years of exposure showed that only the rate of diarrhoea was significantly higher in 
children (11.1) than in adults (2.0, p=0.01). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No cases of acute overdose have been reported. However, neurological disorders (such as cerebellar 
symptoms, diplopia, lateral nystagmus, psychomotor slowdown, hand movements and axial 
hypotonia) have been observed in children who had been voluntarily prescribed more than 2.5 times 
the maximum recommended dose of 100 mg/kg/day for several years. The neurological disorders 
progressively regressed after deferiprone discontinuation. 
In case of overdose, close clinical supervision of the patient is required. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: All other therapeutic products, iron chelating agents, ATC code: 
V03AC02 
Mechanism of action 
The active substance is deferiprone (3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethylpyridin-4-one), a bidentate ligand which 
binds iron in a 3:1 molar ratio. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Clinical studies have demonstrated that Ferriprox is effective in promoting iron excretion and that a 
total dose of 75 mg/kg per day can prevent the progression of iron accumulation as assessed by serum 
ferritin, in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia. Data from the published literature on iron 
balance studies in patients with thalassaemia major show that the use of Ferriprox concurrently with 
deferoxamine (coadministration of both chelators during the same day, either simultaneously or 
sequentially, e.g., Ferriprox during the day and deferoxamine during the night), promotes greater iron 
excretion than either medicinal product alone. Doses of Ferriprox in those studies ranged from 50 to 
100 mg/kg/day and doses of deferoxamine from 40 to 60 mg/kg/day. However, chelation therapy may 
not necessarily protect against iron-induced organ damage. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Clinical efficacy studies were conducted with 500 mg film-coated tablets. 
Studies LA16-0102, LA-01 and LA08-9701 compared the efficacy of Ferriprox with that of 
deferoxamine in controlling serum ferritin in transfusion-dependent thalassaemia patients. Ferriprox 
and deferoxamine were equivalent in promoting a net stabilisation or reduction of body iron load, 
despite the continuous transfusional iron administration in those patients (no difference in proportion 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of patients with a negative trend in serum ferritin between the two treatment groups by regression 
analysis; p > 0.05). 
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method, T2*, was also used to quantify myocardial iron load. 
Iron overload causes concentration-dependent MRI T2* signal loss, thus, increased myocardial iron 
reduces myocardial MRI T2* values. Myocardial MRI T2* values of less than 20 ms represent iron 
overload in the heart. An increase in MRI T2* on treatment indicates that iron is being removed from 
the heart. A positive correlation between MRI T2* values and cardiac function (as measured by left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)) has been documented. 
Study LA16-0102 compared the efficacy of Ferriprox with that of deferoxamine in decreasing cardiac 
iron overload and in improving cardiac function (as measured by LVEF) in transfusion-dependent 
thalassaemia patients. Sixty-one patients with cardiac iron overload, previously treated with 
deferoxamine, were randomised to continue deferoxamine (average dose 43 mg/kg/day; N=31) or to 
switch to Ferriprox (average dose 92 mg/kg/day N=29). Over the 12-month duration of the study, 
Ferriprox was superior to deferoxamine in decreasing cardiac iron load. There was an improvement in 
cardiac T2* of more than 3 ms in patients treated with Ferriprox compared with a change of about 
1 ms in patients treated with deferoxamine. At the same time point, LVEF had increased from baseline 
by 3.07 ± 3.58 absolute units (%) in the Ferriprox group and by 0.32 ± 3.38 absolute units (%) in the 
deferoxamine group (difference between groups; p=0.003). 
Study LA12-9907 compared survival, incidence of cardiac disease, and progression of cardiac disease 
in 129 patients with thalassaemia major treated for at least 4 years with Ferriprox (N=54) or 
deferoxamine (N=75). Cardiac endpoints were assessed by echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, the 
New York Heart Association classification and death due to cardiac disease. There was no significant 
difference in the percentage of patients with cardiac dysfunction at first assessment (13% for Ferriprox 
vs. 16% for deferoxamine). Of patients with cardiac dysfunction at first assessment, none treated with 
deferiprone compared with four (33%) treated with deferoxamine had worsening of their cardiac status 
(p=0.245). Newly diagnosed cardiac dysfunction occurred in 13 (20.6%) deferoxamine-treated 
patients and in 2 (4.3%) Ferriprox-treated patients who were cardiac disease-free at the first 
assessment (p=0.013). Overall, fewer Ferriprox-treated patients than deferoxamine-treated patients 
showed a worsening of cardiac dysfunction from first to last assessment (4% vs. 20%, p=0.007). 
Data from the published literature are consistent with the results from the company-sponsored studies, 
demonstrating less heart disease and/or increased survival in Ferriprox-treated patients than in those 
treated with deferoxamine. 
A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluated the effect of concurrent therapy with 
Ferriprox and deferoxamine in patients with thalassaemia major, who previously received the standard 
chelation monotherapy with subcutaneous deferoxamine and had mild to moderate cardiac iron 
loading (myocardial T2* from 8 to 20 ms). Following randomization, 32 patients received 
deferoxamine (34.9 mg/kg/day for 5 days/week) and Ferriprox (75 mg/kg/day) and 33 patients 
received deferoxamine monotherapy (43.4 mg/kg/day for 5 days/week). After one year of study 
therapy, patients on concurrent chelation therapy had experienced a significantly greater reduction in 
serum ferritin (1 574 µg/l to 598 µg/l with concurrent therapy vs. 1 379 µg/l to 1 146 µg/l with 
deferoxamine monotherapy, p < 0.001), significantly greater reduction in myocardial iron overload, as 
assessed by an increase in MRI T2* (11.7 ms to 17.7 ms with concurrent therapy vs. 12.4 ms to 
15.7 ms with deferoxamine monotherapy, p=0.02) and significantly greater reduction in liver iron 
concentration, also assessed by an increase in MRI T2* (4.9 ms to 10.7 ms with concurrent therapy vs. 
4.2 ms to 5.0 ms with deferoxamine monotherapy, p < 0.001). 
Study LA37-1111 was conducted to evaluate the effect of single therapeutic (33 mg/kg) and 
supratherapeutic (50 mg/kg) oral doses of deferiprone on the cardiac QT interval duration in healthy 
subjects. The maximum difference between the LS means of the therapeutic dose and placebo was 
3.01 ms (95% one-sided UCL: 5.01 ms), and between the LS means of the supratherapeutic dose and 
placebo was 5.23 ms (95% one-sided UCL: 7.19 ms). Ferriprox was concluded to produce no 
significant prolongation of the QT interval.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Deferiprone is rapidly absorbed from the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract. Peak serum 
concentration occurs 45 to 60 minutes following a single dose in fasted patients. This may be extended 
to 2 hours in fed patients. 
Following a dose of 25 mg/kg, lower peak serum concentrations have been detected in patients in the 
fed state (85 µmol/l) than in the fasting state (126 µmol/l), although there was no decrease in the 
amount of deferiprone absorbed when it was given with food. 
Biotransformation 
Deferiprone is metabolised predominantly to a glucuronide conjugate. This metabolite lacks 
iron-binding capability due to inactivation of the 3-hydroxy group of deferiprone. Peak serum 
concentrations of the glucuronide occur 2 to 3 hours after administration of deferiprone. 
Elimination 
In humans, deferiprone is eliminated mainly via the kidneys; 75% to 90% of the ingested dose is 
reported as being recovered in the urine in the first 24 hours, in the form of free deferiprone, the 
glucuronide metabolite and the iron-deferiprone complex. A variable amount of elimination via the 
faeces has been reported. The elimination half-life in most patients is 2 to 3 hours. 
Renal impairment 
An open-label, non-randomized, parallel group clinical study was conducted to evaluate the effect of 
impaired renal function on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single 33 mg/kg oral dose 
of Ferriprox film-coated tablets. Subjects were categorized into 4 groups based on estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): healthy volunteers (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2), mild renal 
impairment (eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73m2), moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m2), 
and severe renal impairment (eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73m2). Systemic exposure to deferiprone and to 
its metabolite deferiprone 3-O-glucuronide was assessed by the PK parameters Cmax and AUC. 
Regardless of the degree of renal impairment, the majority of the dose of Ferriprox was excreted in the 
urine over the first 24 hours as deferiprone 3-O-glucuronide. No significant effect of renal impairment 
was seen on systemic exposure to deferiprone. Systemic exposure to the inactive 3-O-glucuronide 
increased with decreasing eGFR. Based on the results of this study, no adjustment of the Ferriprox 
dose regimen is required in patients with impaired renal function. The safety and pharmacokinetics of 
Ferriprox in patients with end stage renal disease is unknown. 
Hepatic impairment 
An open-label, non-randomized, parallel group clinical study was conducted to evaluate the effect of 
impaired hepatic function on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single 33 mg/kg oral 
dose of Ferriprox film-coated tablets. Subjects were categorized into 3 groups based on the Child-Pugh 
classification score: healthy volunteers, mild hepatic impairment (Class A: 5– 6 points), and moderate 
hepatic impairment (Class B: 7– 9 points). Systemic exposure to deferiprone and to its metabolite 
deferiprone 3-O-glucuronide was assessed by the PK parameters Cmax and AUC. Deferiprone AUCs 
did not differ between treatment groups, but Cmax was decreased by 20% in mildly or moderately 
hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy volunteers. Deferiprone-3-O-glucuronide AUC 
was decreased by 10% and Cmax by 20% in mildly and moderately impaired subjects compared with 
healthy volunteers. A serious adverse event of acute liver and renal injury was seen in one subject with 
moderate hepatic impairment. Based on the results of this study, no adjustment of the Ferriprox dose 
regimen is required in patients with mildly or moderately impaired hepatic function.

The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of deferiprone and deferiprone 
3-O-glucuronide has not been evaluated. The safety and pharmacokinetics of Ferriprox in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment is unknown. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical studies have been conducted in animal species including mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and 
monkeys. 
The most common findings in non-iron-loaded animals at doses of 100 mg/kg/day and above were 
hematologic effects such as bone marrow hypocellularity, and decreased white blood cell (WBC), red 
blood cell (RBC) and/or platelet counts in peripheral blood. 
Atrophy of the thymus, lymphoid tissues, and testis, and hypertrophy of the adrenals, were reported at 
doses of 100 mg/kg/day or greater in non-iron-loaded animals. 
No carcinogenicity studies in animals have been conducted with deferiprone. The genotoxic potential 
of deferiprone was evaluated in a set of in vitro and in vivo tests. Deferiprone did not show direct 
mutagenic properties; however, it did display clastogenic characteristics in in vitro assays and in 
animals. 
Deferiprone was teratogenic and embryotoxic in reproductive studies in non-iron-loaded pregnant rats 
and rabbits at doses at least as low as 25 mg/kg/day. No effects on fertility or early embryonic 
development were noted in non-iron-loaded male and female rats that received deferiprone orally at 
doses of up to 75 mg/kg twice daily for 28 days (males) or 2 weeks (females) prior to mating and until 
termination (males) or through early gestation (females). In females, an effect on the oestrous cycle 
delayed time to confirmed mating at all doses tested. 
No prenatal and postnatal reproductive studies have been conducted in animals.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Ferriprox monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassaemia 
major when current chelation therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. 
Ferriprox in combination with another chelator (see section 4.4) is indicated in patients with 
thalassaemia major when monotherapy with any iron chelator is ineffective, or when prevention or 
treatment of life-threatening consequences of iron overload (mainly cardiac overload) justifies rapid or 
intensive correction (see section 4.2). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Deferiprone therapy should be initiated and maintained by a physician experienced in the treatment of 
patients with thalassaemia. 
Posology 
Deferiprone is usually given as 25 mg/kg body weight, orally, three times a day for a total daily dose 
of 75 mg/kg body weight. Dose per kilogram body weight should be calculated to the nearest 2.5 ml. 
See table below for recommended doses for body weights at 10 kg increments. 
To obtain a dose of about 75 mg/kg/day, use the volume of oral solution suggested in the following 
table for the body weight of the patient. Sample body weights at 10 kg increments are listed.

A total daily dose above 100 mg/kg body weight is not recommended because of the potentially 
increased risk of adverse reactions (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 4.9). 
Dose adjustment 
The effect of Ferriprox in decreasing the body iron is directly influenced by the dose and the degree of 
iron overload. After starting Ferriprox therapy, it is recommended that serum ferritin concentrations, 
or other indicators of body iron load, be monitored every two to three months to assess the long-term 
effectiveness of the chelation regimen in controlling the body iron load. Dose adjustments should be 
tailored to the individual patient’s response and therapeutic goals (maintenance or reduction of body 
iron burden). Interruption of therapy with deferiprone should be considered if serum ferritin falls 
below 500 µg/l. 
Dose adjustments when used with other iron chelators 
In patients for whom monotherapy is inadequate, Ferriprox may be used with deferoxamine at the 
standard dose (75 mg/kg/day) but should not exceed 100 mg/kg/day. 
In the case of iron-induced heart failure, Ferriprox at 75-100 mg/kg/day should be added to 
deferoxamine therapy. The product information of deferoxamine should be consulted. 
Concurrent use of iron chelators is not recommended in patients whose serum ferritin falls below 
500 µg/l due to the risk of excessive iron removal. 
Renal impairment 
Dose adjustment is not required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (see 
section 5.2). The safety and pharmacokinetics of Ferriprox in patients with end stage renal disease are 
unknown. 
Hepatic impairment 
Dose adjustment is not required in patients with mildly or moderately impaired hepatic function (see 
section 5.2). The safety and pharmacokinetics of Ferriprox in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
are unknown. 
Paediatric population 
There are limited data available on the use of deferiprone in children between 6 and 10 years of age, 
and no data on deferiprone use in children under 6 years of age. 
Method of administration 
Oral use.

4.3  Contraindications 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
History of recurrent episodes of neutropenia. 
History of agranulocytosis. 
Pregnancy (see section 4.6). 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
Due to the unknown mechanism of deferiprone-induced neutropenia, patients must not take 
medicinal products known to be associated with neutropenia or those that can cause 
agranulocytosis (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis 
Deferiprone has been shown to cause neutropenia, including agranulocytosis (see section 4.8 
‘Description of selected adverse reactions’). The patient’s absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 
should be monitored every week during the first year of therapy. For patients whose Ferriprox 
has not been interrupted during the first year of therapy due to any decrease in the neutrophil 
count, the frequency of ANC monitoring may be extended to the patient’s blood transfusion 
interval (every 2-4 weeks) after one year of deferiprone therapy. 
The change from weekly ANC monitoring to monitoring at the time of transfusion visits after 
12 months of Ferriprox therapy, should be considered on an individual patient basis, according to the 
physician’s assessment of the patient’s understanding of the risk minimization measures required 
during therapy (see section 4.4 below). 
In clinical studies, weekly monitoring of the neutrophil count has been effective in identifying cases of 
neutropenia and agranulocytosis. Agranulocytosis and neutropenia usually resolve upon 
discontinuation of Ferriprox, but fatal cases of agranulocytosis have been reported. If the patient 
develops an infection while on deferiprone, therapy should be immediately interrupted, and an ANC 
obtained without delay. The neutrophil count should be then monitored more frequently. 
Patients should be aware to contact their physician if they experience any symptoms indicative 
of infection (such as fever, sore throat and flu-like symptoms). Immediately interrupt 
deferiprone if the patient experiences infection. 
Suggested management of cases of neutropenia is outlined below. It is recommended that such a 
management protocol be in place prior to initiating any patient on deferiprone treatment. 
Treatment with deferiprone should not be initiated if the patient is neutropenic. The risk of 
agranulocytosis and neutropenia is higher if the baseline ANC is less than 1.5x109/l. 
For neutropenia events (ANC < 1.5x109/l and > 0.5x109/l): 
Instruct the patient to immediately discontinue deferiprone and all other medicinal products with a 
potential to cause neutropenia. The patient should be advised to limit contact with other individuals in 
order to reduce the risk of infection. Obtain a complete blood cell (CBC) count, with a white blood 
cell (WBC) count, corrected for the presence of nucleated red blood cells, a neutrophil count, and a 
platelet count immediately upon diagnosing the event and then repeat daily. It is recommended that 
following recovery from neutropenia, weekly CBC, WBC, neutrophil and platelet counts continue to 
be obtained for three consecutive weeks, to ensure that the patient has fully recovered. Should any 
evidence of infection develop concurrently with the neutropenia, the appropriate cultures and 
diagnostic procedures should be performed, and an appropriate therapeutic regimen instituted. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For agranulocytosis (ANC < 0.5x109/l): 
Follow the guidelines above and administer appropriate therapy such as granulocyte colony 
stimulating factor, beginning the same day that the event is identified; administer daily until the 
condition resolves. Provide protective isolation and if clinically indicated, admit patient to the hospital. 
Limited information is available regarding rechallenge. Therefore, in the event of neutropenia, 
rechallenge is not recommended. In the event of agranulocytosis, rechallenge is contraindicated. 
Carcinogenicity/mutagenicity 
In view of the genotoxicity results, a carcinogenic potential of deferiprone cannot be excluded (see 
section 5.3). 
Plasma zinc (Zn2+) concentration 
Monitoring of plasma Zn2+ concentration, and supplementation in case of a deficiency, is 
recommended. 
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive or other immunocompromised patients 
No data are available on the use of deferiprone in HIV positive or in other immunocompromised 
patients. Given that deferiprone can be associated with neutropenia and agranulocytosis, therapy in 
immunocompromised patients should not be initiated unless potential benefits outweigh potential 
risks. 
Renal or hepatic impairment and liver fibrosis 
There are no data available on the use of deferiprone in patients with end stage renal disease or severe 
hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). Caution must be exercised in patients with end stage renal 
disease or severe hepatic dysfunction. Renal and hepatic function should be monitored in these patient 
populations during deferiprone therapy. If there is a persistent increase in serum alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), interruption of deferiprone therapy should be considered. 
In thalassaemia patients there is an association between liver fibrosis and iron overload and/or 
hepatitis C. Special care must be taken to ensure that iron chelation in patients with hepatitis C is 
optimal. In these patients careful monitoring of liver histology is recommended. 
Discolouration of urine 
Patients should be informed that their urine may show a reddish/brown discolouration due to the 
excretion of the iron-deferiprone complex. 
Neurological disorders 
Neurological disorders have been observed in children treated with more than 2.5 times the maximum 
recommended dose for several years but have also been observed with standard doses of deferiprone. 
Prescribers are reminded that the use of doses above 100 mg/kg/day are not recommended. 
Deferiprone use should be discontinued if neurological disorders are observed (see sections 4.8 and 
4.9). 
Combined use with other iron chelators 
The use of combination therapy should be considered on a case-by-case basis. The response to therapy 
should be assessed periodically, and the occurrence of adverse events closely monitored. Fatalities and 
life-threatening situations (caused by agranulocytosis) have been reported with deferiprone in 
combination with deferoxamine. Combination therapy with deferoxamine is not recommended when 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
monotherapy with either chelator is adequate or when serum ferritin falls below 500 µg/l. Limited data 
are available on the combined use of Ferriprox and deferasirox, and caution should be applied when 
considering the use of such combination. 
Excipients 
Ferriprox oral solution contains the colouring agent sunset yellow (E110) which may cause allergic 
reactions. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Due to the unknown mechanism of deferiprone-induced neutropenia, patients must not take medicinal 
products known to be associated with neutropenia or those that can cause agranulocytosis (see 
section 4.3). 
Since deferiprone binds to metallic cations, the potential exists for interactions between deferiprone 
and trivalent cation-dependent medicinal products such as aluminium-based antacids. Therefore, it is 
not recommended to concomitantly ingest aluminium-based antacids and deferiprone. 
The safety of concurrent use of deferiprone and vitamin C has not been formally studied. Based on the 
reported adverse interaction that can occur between deferoxamine and vitamin C, caution should be 
used when administering deferiprone and vitamin C concurrently. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/contraception in men and women 
Due to the genotoxic potential of deferiprone (see section 5.3), women of childbearing potential are 
recommended use effective contraceptive measures and avoid becoming pregnant while being treated 
with Ferriprox and for 6 months following the completion of treatment. . 
Men are recommended to use effective contraceptive measures and to not father a child while 
receiving Ferriprox and for 3 months following completion of treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of deferiprone in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Pregnant women must be advised to immediately stop taking deferiprone (see section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether deferiprone is excreted in human milk. No prenatal and postnatal reproductive 
studies have been conducted in animals. Deferiprone must not be used by breast-feeding mothers. If 
treatment is unavoidable, breast-feeding must be stopped (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
No effects on fertility or early embryonic development were noted in animals (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Not relevant.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions reported during therapy with deferiprone in clinical studies were 
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and chromaturia, which were reported in more than 10% of 
patients. The most serious adverse reaction reported in clinical studies with deferiprone was 
agranulocytosis, defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 0.5x109/l, which occurred in 
approximately 1% of patients. Less severe episodes of neutropenia were reported in approximately 5% 
of patients.

The most serious adverse reaction reported in clinical studies with deferiprone is agranulocytosis 
(neutrophils < 0.5x109/l), with an incidence of 1.1% (0.6 cases per 100 patient-years of treatment) (see 
section 4.4). Data from pooled clinical studies in patients with systemic iron overload showed that 
63% of the episodes of agranulocytosis occurred within the first six months of treatment, 74% within 
the first year and 26% after one year of therapy. The median time to onset of the first episode of 
agranulocytosis was 190 days (ranged 22 days- 17.6 years) and median duration was 10 days in 
clinical studies. A fatal outcome was observed in 8.3% of the reported episodes of agranulocytosis 
from clinical studies and post-marketing experience. 
The observed incidence of the less severe form of neutropenia (neutrophils < 1.5x109/l) is 4.9% 
(2.5 cases per 100 patient-years). This rate should be considered in the context of the underlying 
elevated incidence of neutropenia in thalassaemia patients, particularly in those with hypersplenism.

Episodes of diarrhoea, mostly mild and transient, have been reported in patients treated with 
deferiprone. Gastrointestinal effects are more frequent at the beginning of therapy and resolve in most 
patients within a few weeks without the discontinuation of treatment. In some patients it may be 
beneficial to reduce the dose of deferiprone and then scale it back up to the former dose. Arthropathy 
events, which ranged from mild pain in one or more joints to severe arthritis with effusion and 
significant disability, have also been reported in patients treated with deferiprone. Mild arthropathies 
are generally transient. 
Increased levels of serum liver enzymes have been reported in some patients taking deferiprone. In the 
majority of these patients, the increase was asymptomatic and transient, and returned to baseline 
without discontinuation or decreasing the dose of deferiprone (see section 4.4). 
Some patients experienced progression of fibrosis associated with an increase in iron overload or 
hepatitis C. 
Low plasma zinc levels have been associated with deferiprone in a minority of patients. The levels 
normalised with oral zinc supplementation. 
Neurological disorders (such as cerebellar symptoms, diplopia, lateral nystagmus, psychomotor 
slowdown, hand movements and axial hypotonia) have been observed in children who had been 
voluntarily prescribed more than 2.5 times the maximum recommended dose of 100 mg/kg/day for 
several years. Episodes of hypotonia, instability, inability to walk, and hypertonia with inability of 
limb movement, have been reported in children in the post-marketing setting with standard doses of 
deferiprone. The neurological disorders progressively regressed after deferiprone discontinuation (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.9). 
The safety profile of combination therapy (deferiprone and deferoxamine) observed in clinical studies, 
post-marketing experience or published literature was consistent with that characterised for 
monotherapy. 
Data from the pooled safety database from clinical studies (1 343 patient-years exposure to Ferriprox 
monotherapy and 244 patient-years exposure to Ferriprox and deferoxamine) showed statistically 
significant (p<0.05) differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on System Organ Class for 
“Cardiac disorders", "Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders” and "Renal and urinary 
disorders". The incidences of “Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders” and "Renal and 
urinary disorders" were lower during combination therapy than monotherapy, whereas the incidence of 
“Cardiac disorders" was higher during combination therapy than monotherapy. The higher rate of 
“Cardiac disorders" reported during combination therapy than monotherapy was possibly due to the 
higher incidence of pre-existing cardiac disorders in patients who received combination therapy. 
Careful monitoring of cardiac events in patients on combination therapy is warranted (see section 4.4). 
The incidences of adverse reactions experienced by 18 children and 97 adults treated with combination 
therapy were not significantly different between the two age groups except in the incidence of 
arthropathy (11.1% in children vs. none in adults, p=0.02). Evaluation of rate of reactions per 
100 patient-years of exposure showed that only the rate of diarrhoea was significantly higher in 
children (11.1) than in adults (2.0, p=0.01). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.9  Overdose 
No cases of acute overdose have been reported. However, neurological disorders (such as cerebellar 
symptoms, diplopia, lateral nystagmus, psychomotor slowdown, hand movements and axial 
hypotonia) have been observed in children who had been voluntarily prescribed more than 2.5 times 
the maximum recommended dose of 100 mg/kg/day for several years. The neurological disorders 
progressively regressed after deferiprone discontinuation. 
In case of overdose, close clinical supervision of the patient is required.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: All other therapeutic products, iron chelating agents, ATC code: 
V03AC02 
Mechanism of action 
The active substance is deferiprone (3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethylpyridin-4-one), a bidentate ligand which 
binds iron in a 3:1 molar ratio. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Clinical studies have demonstrated that Ferriprox is effective in promoting iron excretion and that a 
total dose of 75 mg/kg per day can prevent the progression of iron accumulation as assessed by serum 
ferritin, in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia. Data from the published literature on iron 
balance studies in patients with thalassaemia major show that the use of Ferriprox concurrently with 
deferoxamine (coadministration of both chelators during the same day, either simultaneously or 
sequentially, e.g., Ferriprox during the day and deferoxamine during the night), promotes greater iron 
excretion than either medicinal product alone. Doses of Ferriprox in those studies ranged from 50 to 
100 mg/kg/day and doses of deferoxamine from 40 to 60 mg/kg/day. However, chelation therapy may 
not necessarily protect against iron-induced organ damage. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Clinical efficacy studies were conducted with 500 mg film-coated tablets. 
Studies LA16-0102, LA-01 and LA08-9701 compared the efficacy of Ferriprox with that of 
deferoxamine in controlling serum ferritin in transfusion-dependent thalassaemia patients. Ferriprox 
and deferoxamine were equivalent in promoting a net stabilisation or reduction of body iron load, 
despite the continuous transfusional iron administration in those patients (no difference in proportion 
of patients with a negative trend in serum ferritin between the two treatment groups by regression 
analysis; p > 0.05). 
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method, T2*, was also used to quantify myocardial iron load. 
Iron overload causes concentration-dependent MRI T2* signal loss, thus, increased myocardial iron 
reduces myocardial MRI T2* values. Myocardial MRI T2* values of less than 20 ms represent iron 
overload in the heart. An increase in MRI T2* on treatment indicates that iron is being removed from 
the heart. A positive correlation between MRI T2* values and cardiac function (as measured by left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)) has been documented. 
Study LA16-0102 compared the efficacy of Ferriprox with that of deferoxamine in decreasing cardiac 
iron overload and in improving cardiac function (as measured by LVEF) in transfusion-dependent 
thalassaemia patients. Sixty-one patients with cardiac iron overload, previously treated with 
deferoxamine, were randomised to continue deferoxamine (average dose 43 mg/kg/day; N=31) or to 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
switch to Ferriprox (average dose 92 mg/kg/day N=29). Over the 12-month duration of the study, 
Ferriprox was superior to deferoxamine in decreasing cardiac iron load. There was an improvement in 
cardiac T2* of more than 3 ms in patients treated with Ferriprox compared with a change of about 
1 ms in patients treated with deferoxamine. At the same time point, LVEF had increased from baseline 
by 3.07 ± 3.58 absolute units (%) in the Ferriprox group and by 0.32 ± 3.38 absolute units (%) in the 
deferoxamine group (difference between groups; p=0.003). 
Study LA12-9907 compared survival, incidence of cardiac disease, and progression of cardiac disease 
in 129 patients with thalassaemia major treated for at least 4 years with Ferriprox (N=54) or 
deferoxamine (N=75). Cardiac endpoints were assessed by echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, the 
New York Heart Association classification and death due to cardiac disease. There was no significant 
difference in the percentage of patients with cardiac dysfunction at first assessment (13% for Ferriprox 
vs. 16% for deferoxamine). Of patients with cardiac dysfunction at first assessment, none treated with 
deferiprone compared with four (33%) treated with deferoxamine had worsening of their cardiac status 
(p=0.245). Newly diagnosed cardiac dysfunction occurred in 13 (20.6%) deferoxamine-treated 
patients and in 2 (4.3%) Ferriprox-treated patients who were cardiac disease-free at the first 
assessment (p=0.013). Overall, fewer Ferriprox-treated patients than deferoxamine-treated patients 
showed a worsening of cardiac dysfunction from first to last assessment (4% vs. 20%, p=0.007). 
Data from the published literature are consistent with the results from the company-sponsored studies, 
demonstrating less heart disease and/or increased survival in Ferriprox-treated patients than in those 
treated with deferoxamine. 
A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluated the effect of concurrent therapy with 
Ferriprox and deferoxamine in patients with thalassaemia major, who previously received the standard 
chelation monotherapy with subcutaneous deferoxamine and had mild to moderate cardiac iron 
loading (myocardial T2* from 8 to 20 ms). Following randomization, 32 patients received 
deferoxamine (34.9 mg/kg/day for 5 days/week) and Ferriprox (75 mg/kg/day) and 33 patients 
received deferoxamine monotherapy (43.4 mg/kg/day for 5 days/week). After one year of study 
therapy, patients on concurrent chelation therapy had experienced a significantly greater reduction in 
serum ferritin (1 574 µg/l to 598 µg/l with concurrent therapy vs. 1 379 µg/l to 1 146 µg/l with 
deferoxamine monotherapy, p<0.001), significantly greater reduction in myocardial iron overload, as 
assessed by an increase in MRI T2* (11.7 ms to 17.7 ms with concurrent therapy vs. 12.4 ms to 
15.7 ms with deferoxamine monotherapy, p=0.02) and significantly greater reduction in liver iron 
concentration, also assessed by an increase in MRI T2* (4.9 ms to 10.7 ms with concurrent therapy vs. 
4.2 ms to 5.0 ms with deferoxamine monotherapy, p<0.001). 
Study LA37-1111 was conducted to evaluate the effect of single therapeutic (33 mg/kg) and 
supratherapeutic (50 mg/kg) oral doses of deferiprone on the cardiac QT interval duration in healthy 
subjects. The maximum difference between the LS means of the therapeutic dose and placebo was 
3.01 ms (95% one-sided UCL: 5.01 ms), and between the LS means of the supratherapeutic dose and 
placebo was 5.23 ms (95% one-sided UCL: 7.19 ms). Ferriprox was concluded to produce no 
significant prolongation of the QT interval. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Deferiprone is rapidly absorbed from the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract. Peak serum 
concentration occurs 45 to 60 minutes following a single dose in fasted patients. This may be extended 
to 2 hours in fed patients. 
Following a dose of 25 mg/kg, lower peak serum concentrations have been detected in patients in the 
fed state (85 µmol/l) than in the fasting state (126 µmol/l), although there was no decrease in the 
amount of deferiprone absorbed when it was given with food. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
Deferiprone is metabolised predominantly to a glucuronide conjugate. This metabolite lacks 
iron-binding capability due to inactivation of the 3-hydroxy group of deferiprone. Peak serum 
concentrations of the glucuronide occur 2 to 3 hours after administration of deferiprone. 
Elimination 
In humans, deferiprone is eliminated mainly via the kidneys; 75% to 90% of the ingested dose is 
reported as being recovered in the urine in the first 24 hours, in the form of free deferiprone, the 
glucuronide metabolite and the iron-deferiprone complex. A variable amount of elimination via the 
faeces has been reported. The elimination half-life in most patients is 2 to 3 hours. 
Renal impairment 
An open-label, non-randomized, parallel group clinical study was conducted to evaluate the effect of 
impaired renal function on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single 33 mg/kg oral dose 
of Ferriprox film-coated tablets. Subjects were categorized into 4 groups based on estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): healthy volunteers (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2), mild renal 
impairment (eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73m2), moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30–
59 mL/min/1.73m2), and severe renal impairment (eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73m2). Systemic exposure 
to deferiprone and to its metabolite deferiprone 3-O-glucuronide was assessed by the PK parameters 
Cmax and AUC. 
Regardless of the degree of renal impairment, the majority of the dose of Ferriprox was excreted in the 
urine over the first 24 hours as deferiprone 3-O-glucuronide. No significant effect of renal impairment 
was seen on systemic exposure to deferiprone. Systemic exposure to the inactive 3-O-glucuronide 
increased with decreasing eGFR. Based on the results of this study, no adjustment of the Ferriprox 
dose regimen is required in patients with impaired renal function. The safety and pharmacokinetics of 
Ferriprox in patients with end stage renal disease is unknown. 
Hepatic impairment 
An open-label, non-randomized, parallel group clinical study was conducted to evaluate the effect of 
impaired hepatic function on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single 33 mg/kg oral 
dose of Ferriprox film-coated tablets. Subjects were categorized into 3 groups based on the Child-Pugh 
classification score: healthy volunteers, mild hepatic impairment (Class A: 5– 6 points), and moderate 
hepatic impairment (Class B: 7– 9 points). Systemic exposure to deferiprone and to its metabolite 
deferiprone 3-O-glucuronide was assessed by the PK parameters Cmax and AUC. Deferiprone AUCs 
did not differ between treatment groups, but Cmax was decreased by 20% in mildly or moderately 
hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy volunteers. Deferiprone-3-O-glucuronide AUC 
was decreased by 10% and Cmax by 20% in mildly and moderately impaired subjects compared with 
healthy volunteers. A serious adverse event of acute liver and renal injury was seen in one subject with 
moderate hepatic impairment. Based on the results of this study, no adjustment of the Ferriprox dose 
regimen is required in patients with mildly or moderately impaired hepatic function. 
The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of deferiprone and deferiprone 
3-O-glucuronide has not been evaluated. The safety and pharmacokinetics of Ferriprox in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment is unknown. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical studies have been conducted in animal species including mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and 
monkeys. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The most common findings in non-iron-loaded animals at doses of 100 mg/kg/day and above were 
hematologic effects such as bone marrow hypocellularity, and decreased white blood cell (WBC), red 
blood cell (RBC) and/or platelet counts in peripheral blood. 
Atrophy of the thymus, lymphoid tissues, and testis, and hypertrophy of the adrenals, were reported at 
doses of 100 mg/kg/day or greater in non-iron-loaded animals. 
No carcinogenicity studies in animals have been conducted with deferiprone. The genotoxic potential 
of deferiprone was evaluated in a set of in vitro and in vivo tests. Deferiprone did not show direct 
mutagenic properties; however, it did display clastogenic characteristics in in vitro assays and in 
animals. 
Deferiprone was teratogenic and embryotoxic in reproductive studies in non-iron-loaded pregnant rats 
and rabbits at doses at least as low as 25 mg/kg/day. No effects on fertility or early embryonic 
development were noted in non-iron-loaded male and female rats that received deferiprone orally at 
doses of up to 75 mg/kg twice daily for 28 days (males) or 2 weeks (females) prior to mating and until 
termination (males) or through early gestation (females). In females, an effect on the oestrous cycle 
delayed time to confirmed mating at all doses tested. 
No prenatal and postnatal reproductive studies have been conducted in animals.

MONITORING YOUR WHITE BLOOD 
CELL COUNT WITH FERRIPROX 
Make sure you do the following: 
There is a small chance that you may develop 
agranulocytosis (very low white blood cell 
count) while taking Ferriprox, which may lead 
to a serious infection. Even though 
agranulocytosis only affects 1 to 2 out of 
100 users, it is important to monitor your blood 
on a regular basis. 
1. Have your blood monitored on a weekly basis 
for the first one year of treatment with Ferriprox 
and as regularly as your doctor recommends 
thereafter. 
2. If you get any symptoms of infection such as 
fever, sore throat or flu-like symptoms, 
immediately seek medical attention. Your white 
blood cell count must be checked within 
24 hours in order to detect potential 
agranulocytosis.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Ferriprox is and what it is used for 
Ferriprox contains the active substance deferiprone. Ferriprox is an iron chelator, a type of medicine 
that removes excess iron from the body. 
Ferriprox is used to treat iron overload caused by frequent blood transfusions in patients with 
thalassaemia major when current chelation therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Ferriprox 
Do not take Ferriprox 
− 
if you are allergic to deferiprone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have a history of repeated episodes of neutropenia (low white blood cell (neutrophil) 
count). 
if you have a history of agranulocytosis (very low white blood cell (neutrophil) count). 
if you are currently taking medicines known to cause neutropenia or agranulocytosis (see “Other 
medicines and Ferriprox”). 
if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.

Warnings and precautions 
− 
the most serious side effect that may occur while taking Ferriprox is a very low white blood cell 
(neutrophil) count. This condition, known as severe neutropenia or agranulocytosis, has 
occurred in 1 to 2 out of 100 people who have taken Ferriprox in clinical studies. Because white 
blood cells help to fight infection, a low neutrophil count may place you at risk of developing a 
serious and potentially life-threatening infection. To monitor for neutropenia, your doctor will 
ask you to have a blood test (to check your white blood cell count) performed regularly, as 
frequently as every week, while you are being treated with Ferriprox. It is very important for 
you to keep all of these appointments. Please refer to the patient card attached to the carton. If 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
you get any symptoms of infection such as fever, sore throat or flu-like symptoms, immediately 
seek medical attention. Your white blood cell count must be checked within 24 hours in order to 
detect potential agranulocytosis. 
if you are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive or if your liver or kidney function is 
severely impaired, your doctor may recommend additional tests. 
− 
Your doctor will also ask you to come in for tests to monitor body iron load. In addition he or she 
might ask you to undergo liver biopsies. 
Other medicines and Ferriprox 
Do not take medicines known to cause neutropenia or agranulocytosis (see “Do not take Ferriprox”). 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
Do not take aluminium-based antacids at the same time as taking Ferriprox. 
Please consult with your doctor or pharmacist before taking vitamin C with Ferriprox. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Ferriprox may cause harm to unborn babies when used by pregnant women. Ferriprox must not be 
used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you are pregnant or you become pregnant during 
treatment with Ferriprox, get medical advice immediately. 
Both female and male patients are recommended to take special precautions in their sexual activity if 
there is any possibility for pregnancy to occur: Women of childbearing potential are recommended to 
use effective contraception during treatment with Ferriprox and for 6 months after the last dose. Men 
are recommended to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose. 
This should be discussed with your doctor. 
Do not use Ferriprox if you are breast-feeding. Please refer to the patient card attached to the carton. 
Driving and using machines 
Not relevant. 
3.  How to take Ferriprox 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. The amount of Ferriprox that you take will depend on your weight. The usual dose 
is 25 mg/kg, 3 times per day, for a total daily dose of 75 mg/kg. The total daily dose should not exceed 
100 mg/kg. Take your first dose in the morning. Take your second dose midday. Take your third dose 
in the evening. Ferriprox can be taken with or without food; however, you may find it easier to 
remember to take Ferriprox if you take it with your meals. 
If you take more Ferriprox than you should 
There are no reports of acute overdose with Ferriprox. If you have accidentally taken more than the 
prescribed dose, you should contact your doctor. 
If you forget to take Ferriprox 
Ferriprox will be most effective if you do not miss any doses. If you do miss one dose take it as soon 
as you remember and take your next dose at its regularly scheduled time. If you miss more than one 
dose do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses, just continue with your 
normal schedule. Do not change your daily dose without first talking to your doctor.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
The most serious side effect of Ferriprox is a very low white blood cell (neutrophil) count. This 
condition, known as severe neutropenia or agranulocytosis, has occurred in 1 to 2 out of 100 people 
who have taken Ferriprox in clinical studies. A low white blood cell count can be associated with a 
serious and potentially life-threatening infection. Report immediately to your doctor any symptoms of 
infection such as: fever, sore throat or flu-like symptoms. 
Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
− 
− 
− 
−

Neurological disorders (such as tremors, walking disorders, double vision, involuntary muscle 
contractions, problems with movement coordination) have been reported in children who had been 
voluntarily prescribed more than double the maximum recommended dose of 100 mg/kg/day for 
several years and have also been observed in children with standard doses of deferiprone. The children 
recovered from these symptoms after Ferriprox discontinuation. 
Reporting of side effects

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Ferriprox is and what it is used for 
Ferriprox contains the active substance deferiprone. Ferriprox is an iron chelator, a type of medicine 
that removes excess iron from the body. 
Ferriprox is used to treat iron overload caused by frequent blood transfusions in patients with 
thalassaemia major when current chelation therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Ferriprox 
Do not take Ferriprox 
− 
if you are allergic to deferiprone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have a history of repeated episodes of neutropenia (low white blood cell (neutrophil) 
count). 
if you have a history of agranulocytosis (very low white blood cell (neutrophil) count). 
if you are currently taking medicines known to cause neutropenia or agranulocytosis (see “Other 
medicines and Ferriprox”). 
if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.

Warnings and precautions 
− 
the most serious side effect that may occur while taking Ferriprox is a very low white blood cell 
(neutrophil) count. This condition, known as severe neutropenia or agranulocytosis, has 
occurred in 1 to 2 out of 100 people who have taken Ferriprox in clinical studies. Because white 
blood cells help to fight infection, a low neutrophil count may place you at risk of developing a 
serious and potentially life-threatening infection. To monitor for neutropenia, your doctor will 
ask you to have a blood test (to check your white blood cell count) performed regularly, as 
frequently as every week, while you are being treated with Ferriprox. It is very important for 
you to keep all of these appointments. Please refer to the patient card attached to the carton. If 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
you get any symptoms of infection such as fever, sore throat or flu-like symptoms, immediately 
seek medical attention. Your white blood cell count must be checked within 24 hours in order to 
detect potential agranulocytosis. 
if you are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive or if your liver or kidney function is 
severely impaired, your doctor may recommend additional tests. 
− 
Your doctor will also ask you to come in for tests to monitor body iron load. In addition he or she 
might ask you to undergo liver biopsies. 
Other medicines and Ferriprox 
Do not take medicines known to cause neutropenia or agranulocytosis (see “Do not take Ferriprox”). 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
Do not take aluminium-based antacids at the same time as taking Ferriprox. 
Please consult with your doctor or pharmacist before taking vitamin C with Ferriprox. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Ferriprox may cause harm to unborn babies when used by pregnant women. Ferriprox must not be 
used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you are pregnant or you become pregnant during 
treatment with Ferriprox, get medical advice immediately. 
Both female and male patients are recommended to take special precautions in their sexual activity if 
there is any possibility for pregnancy to occur: Women of childbearing potential are recommended to 
use effective contraception during treatment with Ferriprox and for 6 months after the last dose. Men 
are recommended to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose. 
This should be discussed with your doctor. 
Do not use Ferriprox if you are breast-feeding. Please refer to the patient card attached to the carton. 
Driving and using machines 
Not relevant. 
3.  How to take Ferriprox 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. The amount of Ferriprox that you take will depend on your weight. The usual dose 
is 25 mg/kg, 3 times per day, for a total daily dose of 75 mg/kg. The total daily dose should not exceed 
100 mg/kg. Take your first dose in the morning. Take your second dose midday. Take your third dose 
in the evening. Ferriprox can be taken with or without food; however, you may find it easier to 
remember to take Ferriprox if you take it with your meals. 
If you take more Ferriprox than you should 
There are no reports of acute overdose with Ferriprox. If you have accidentally taken more than the 
prescribed dose, you should contact your doctor. 
If you forget to take Ferriprox 
Ferriprox will be most effective if you do not miss any doses. If you do miss one dose take it as soon 
as you remember and take your next dose at its regularly scheduled time. If you miss more than one 
dose do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses, just continue with your 
normal schedule. Do not change your daily dose without first talking to your doctor.

4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
The most serious side effect of Ferriprox is a very low white blood cell (neutrophil) count. This 
condition, known as severe neutropenia or agranulocytosis, has occurred in 1 to 2 out of 100 people 
who have taken Ferriprox in clinical studies. A low white blood cell count can be associated with a 
serious and potentially life-threatening infection. Report immediately to your doctor any symptoms of 
infection such as: fever, sore throat or flu-like symptoms. 
Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
−

Events of joint pain and swelling ranged from mild pain in one or more joints to severe disability. In 
most cases, the pain disappeared while patients continued taking Ferriprox. 
Neurological disorders (such as tremors, walking disorders, double vision, involuntary muscle 
contractions, problems with movement coordination) have been reported in children who had been 
voluntarily prescribed more than double the maximum recommended dose of 100 mg/kg/day for 
several years and have also been observed in children with standard doses of deferiprone. The children 
recovered from these symptoms after Ferriprox discontinuation. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of

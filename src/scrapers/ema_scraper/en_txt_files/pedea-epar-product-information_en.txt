Excipients: each ml contains 7.5 mg of sodium. 
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Solution for injection. 
Clear, colourless to slightly yellow solution. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of a haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in preterm newborn infants less 
than 34 weeks of gestational age.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Pedea should only be carried out in a neonatal intensive care unit under the 
supervision of an experienced neonatologist. 
Posology 
A course of therapy is defined as three intravenous injections of Pedea given at 24-hour intervals. The 
first injection should be given after the first 6 hours of life. 
The ibuprofen dose is adjusted to the body weight as follows: 
-   1st injection: 10 mg/kg, 
-   2nd and 3rd injections: 5 mg/kg. 
If anuria or manifest oliguria occurs after the first or second dose, the next dose should be withheld 
until urine output returns to normal levels. 
If the ductus arteriosus does not close 48 hours after the last injection or if it re-opens, a second course 
of 3 doses, as above, may be given. 
If the condition is unchanged after the second course of therapy, surgery of the patent ductus 
arteriosus may then be necessary. 
Method of administration 
For intravenous use only. 
Pedea should be administered as a short infusion over 15 minutes, preferably undiluted. If necessary, 
the injection volume may be adjusted with either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for 
injection or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection. Any unused portion of the solution should 
be discarded. 
The total volume of solution injected should take into account the total daily fluid volume 
administered.

4.3  Contraindications 
-  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients; 
-  Life-threatening infection; 
-  Active bleeding, especially intracranial or gastrointestinal haemorrhage; 
-  Thrombocytopenia or coagulation defects; 
-  Significant impairment of renal function; 
-  Congenital heart disease in which patency of the ductus arteriosus is necessary for satisfactory 
pulmonary or systemic blood flow (e.g. pulmonary atresia, severe tetralogy of Fallot, severe 
coarctation of the aorta); 
-  Known or suspected necrotising enterocolitis; 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Before administration of Pedea an adequate echocardiographic examination should be performed in 
order to detect a haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus and to exclude pulmonary 
hypertension and ductal-dependent congenital heart disease. 
Since prophylactic use in the first 3 days of life (starting within 6 hours of birth) in preterm newborn 
infants less than 28 weeks of gestational age was associated with increased pulmonary and renal 
adverse events, Pedea should not be used prophylactically at any gestational age (see sections 4.8 and 
5.1). In particular, severe hypoxemia with pulmonary hypertension was reported in 3 infants within 
one hour of the first infusion and was reversed within 30 min after start of inhaled nitric oxide therapy. 
If hypoxaemia occurs during or following Pedea infusion, close attention should be paid to pulmonary 
pressure. 
Since ibuprofen was shown in vitro to displace bilirubin from its binding site to albumin, the risk of 
bilirubin encephalopathy in premature newborn infants may be increased (see section 5.2). Therefore, 
ibuprofen should not be used in infants with marked elevated bilirubin concentration. 
As a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), ibuprofen may mask the usual signs and 
symptoms of infection. Pedea must therefore be used cautiously in the presence of an infection (see 
also section 4.3). 
Pedea should be administered carefully to avoid extravasation and potential resultant irritation to 
tissues. 
As ibuprofen may inhibit platelet aggregation, premature neonates should be monitored for signs of 
bleeding. 
As ibuprofen may decrease the clearance of aminoglycosides, strict surveillance of their serum levels 
is recommended during co-administration with ibuprofen. 
Careful monitoring of both renal and gastrointestinal function is recommended. 
Severe skin reactions  
Serious skin reactions, some of them fatal, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, 
and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported rarely in association with the use of NSAIDSs (see 
section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk of these reactions early in the course of therapy, the 
onset  of  the  reaction  occurring  in  the  majority  of  cases  within  the  first  month  of  treatment.  Acute 
generalised  exanthematous  pustulosis  (AGEP)  has  been  reported  in  relation  to  ibuprofen-containing 
products. Ibuprofen should be discontinued, at the first appearance of signs and symptoms of severe 
skin reactions, such as skin rash, mucosal lesions, or any other sign of hypersensitivity. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In preterm newborn infants less than 27 weeks of gestational age, the closure rate of the ductus 
arteriosus (33 to 50%) was shown to be low at the recommended dose regimen (see section 5.1). 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (15 mg) per 2 ml, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The concomitant use of Pedea with the following medicinal products is not recommended: 
-  diuretics: ibuprofen may reduce the effect of diuretics; diuretics can increase the risk of 
nephrotoxicity of NSAIDs in dehydrated patients. 
-  anticoagulants: ibuprofen may increase the effect of anticoagulants and enhance the risk of 
bleeding. 
-  corticosteroids: ibuprofen may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. 
-  nitric oxide: since both medicinal products inhibit platelet function, their combination may in theory 
increase the risk of bleeding. 
-  other NSAIDs: the concomitant use of more than one NSAID should be avoided because of the 
increased risk of adverse reactions. 
-  aminoglycosides: since ibuprofen may decrease the clearance of aminoglycosides, their co-
administration may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity (see section 4.4).

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Data are currently available on approximately 1,000 preterm newborn from both the literature 
concerning ibuprofen and clinical trials with Pedea. Causality of adverse events reported in the 
preterm newborn is difficult to assess since they may be related to the haemodynamic consequences of 
the patent ductus arteriosus as well as to direct effects of ibuprofen. 
Reported adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are 
defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥1/100, <1/10) and uncommon (≥1/1,000, <1/100). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

* see below 
In a clinical curative trial involving 175 preterm newborn infants less than 35 weeks of gestational 
age, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks post-conceptional age was 13/81 (16%) 
for indomethacin versus 23/94 (24%) for ibuprofen. 
In a clinical trial where Pedea was administered prophylactically during the first 6 hours of life, severe 
hypoxemia with pulmonary hypertension was reported in 3 newborn infants less than 28 weeks of 
gestational age. This occurred within one hour of the first infusion and was reversed within 30 minutes 
after the inhalation of nitric oxide. There have also been post-marketing reports of pulmonary 
hypertension where Pedea was administered to premature neonates in the therapeutic setting. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No case of overdose has been reported with intravenous ibuprofen in preterm newborn infants. 
However, overdose has been described in infants and children administered oral ibuprofen: CNS 
depression, seizures, gastrointestinal disturbances, bradycardia, hypotension, apnoea, abnormal renal 
function, haematuria have been observed. 
Massive overdose (up to more than 1000 mg/kg) has been reported to induce coma, metabolic 
acidosis, and transient renal failure. All patients recovered with conventional treatment. Only one 
recorded death has been published: after an overdose of 469 mg/kg, a 16-month old child developed 
an apnoeic episode with seizures and a fatal aspiration pneumonia. 
The management of ibuprofen overdose is primarily supportive.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: other cardiac preparations, ATC code: C01 EB16 
Ibuprofen is a NSAID that possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity. Ibuprofen 
is a racemic mixture of S(+) and R(-) enantiomers. In vivo and in vitro studies indicate that the S(+) 
isomer is responsible for the clinical activity. Ibuprofen is a non selective inhibitor of cyclo-
oxygenase, leading to reduced synthesis of prostaglandins. 
Since prostaglandins are involved in the persistence of the ductus arteriosus after birth, this effect is 
believed to be the main mechanism of action of ibuprofen in this indication. 
In a dose-response study of Pedea in 40 preterm newborn infants, the ductus arteriosus closure rate 
associated to the 10-5-5 mg/kg dose regimen was 75% (6/8) in neonates of 27-29 weeks’ gestation and 
33% (2/6) in neonates of 24-26 weeks’ gestation. 
Prophylactic use of Pedea in the first 3 days of life (starting within 6 hours of birth) in preterm 
newborn infants less than 28 weeks of gestational age was associated with increased incidence of renal 
failure and pulmonary adverse events including hypoxia, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary 
haemorrhage, as compared to curative use. Conversely, a lower incidence of neonatal grade III-IV 
intraventricular haemorrhage and of surgical ligation was associated with prophylactic use of Pedea.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Distribution 
Although a great variability is observed in the premature population, peak plasma concentrations are 
measured around 35-40 mg/l after the initial loading dose of 10 mg/kg as well as after the last 
maintenance dose, whatever gestational and postnatal age. Residual concentrations are around 10-
15 mg/l 24 hours after the last dose of 5 mg/kg. 
Plasma concentrations of the S-enantiomer are much higher than those of the R-enantiomer, which 
reflects a rapid chiral inversion of the R- to the S-form in a proportion similar to adults (about 60%). 
The apparent volume of distribution is on average 200 ml/kg (62 to 350 according to various studies). 
The central volume of distribution may depend on the status of the ductus and decrease as the ductus 
closes. 
In vitro studies suggest that, similarly to other NSAIDs, ibuprofen is highly bound to plasma albumin, 
although this seems to be significantly lower (95 %) compared with adult plasma (99 %). Ibuprofen 
competes with bilirubin for albumin binding in newborn infant serum and, as a consequence, the free 
fraction of bilirubin may be increased at high ibuprofen concentrations. 
Elimination 
Elimination rate is markedly lower than in older children and adults, with an elimination half-life 
estimated at approximately 30 hours (16–43). The clearance of both enantiomers increases with 
gestational age, at least in the range of 24 to 28 weeks. 
PK-PD relationship 
In preterm newborns ibuprofen significantly reduced plasma concentrations of prostaglandins and 
their metabolites, particularly PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF-1-alpha. Low levels were sustained up to 
72 hours in neonates who received 3 doses of ibuprofen, whereas subsequent re-increases were 
observed at 72 hours after only 1 dose of ibuprofen. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
There are no preclinical data considered relevant to clinical safety beyond data included in other 
sections of this Summary of Product Characteristics. With the exception of an acute toxicity study, no 
further studies have been carried out in juvenile animals with Pedea.

6.5  Nature and contents of container 
2 ml solution in a colourless type 1 glass ampoule. 
Pedea is supplied in packs of 4 x 2 ml ampoules. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
As for all parenteral products, ampoules of Pedea should be visually inspected for particulate matter 
and the integrity of the container prior to use. Ampoules are intended for single use only, any unused 
portions must be discarded.  
Chlorhexidine must not be used to disinfect the neck of the ampoule as it is not compatible with the 
Pedea solution. Therefore, for asepsis of the ampoule before use, ethanol 60% or isopropyl alcohol 
70% is recommended. 
When disinfecting the neck of the ampoule with an antiseptic, to avoid any interaction with the Pedea 
solution, the ampoule must be completely dry before it is opened. 
The required volume to be given to the infant should be determined according to body weight, and 
should be injected intravenously as a short infusion over 15 minutes, preferably undiluted. 
Use only sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution to 
adjust injection volume. 
The total volume of solution injected to preterm infants should take into account the total daily fluid 
volume administered. A maximal volume of 80 ml/kg/day on the first day of life should usually be 
respected; this should be progressively increased in the following 1-2 weeks (about 20 ml/kg 
birthweight/day) up to a maximal volume of 180 ml/kg birthweight/day. 
Before and after administration of Pedea, to avoid contact with any acidic solution, rinse the infusion 
line over 15 minutes with 1.5 to 2 ml of either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) or glucose 50 mg/ml 
(5%), solution for injection. 
After first opening of an ampoule, any unused portions must be discarded. 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

Further information 
1.  WHAT PEDEA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
While a baby is inside its mother’s womb it does not need to use its lungs. An unborn baby has a blood 
vessel called the ductus arteriosus near the heart which allows the baby’s blood to bypass the lungs and 
circulate to the rest of the body. 
When the baby is born and starts using its lungs the ductus arteriosus normally closes. However, in 
some cases this does not happen. The medical term for this condition is ‘patent ductus arteriosus’, i.e. 
an open ductus arteriosus. This can cause heart problems in your baby. This condition is much more 
frequent in premature newborn than in full-term newborn infants. 
Pedea, when given to your baby, can help to close the ductus arteriosus. 
The  active  substance  in  Pedea  is  ibuprofen.  Pedea  closes  the  ductus  arteriosus  by  inhibiting  the 
production  of  prostaglandin,  a  naturally  occurring  chemical  in  the  body  which  keeps  the  ductus 
arteriosus open. 
2. 
BEFORE PEDEA IS ADMINISTERED TO YOUR BABY 
Pedea will only be given to your baby in a special neonatal intensive care unit by qualified health care 
professionals. 
Do not use Pedea 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if your baby is allergic (hypersensitive) to ibuprofen or any of the other ingredients of Pedea; 
if your baby has a life-threatening infection which has not been treated; 
if your baby is bleeding, especially if the bleeding is inside the skull or in the intestines; 
if your baby has a decrease of blood cells called platelets (thrombocytopenia) or other problems 
with their blood clotting; 
if your baby has kidney problems; 
if your baby has other problems with their heart which require the ductus arteriosus to remain open 
so that adequate circulation of the blood is maintained; 
if your baby has or is suspected to have certain problems with their intestines (a condition called 
necrotising enterocolitis); 
- 
- 
- 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Take special care with Pedea 
-  Before treatment with Pedea, your baby’s heart will be examined to confirm that the ductus 
arteriosus is open. 
-  Pedea should not be given in the first 6 hours of life. 
- 
If your baby is suspected of having liver disease, signs and symptoms of which include yellowing 
of the skin and eyes. 
If your baby is already suffering from an infection that is being treated, the doctor will treat your 
baby with Pedea only after careful consideration of your baby’s condition. 
- 
-  Pedea should be carefully administered to your baby by the healthcare professional, to avoid 
- 
damage to the skin and surrounding tissues. 
Ibuprofen may reduce the ability of your baby’s blood to clot. Your baby should therefore be 
watched for signs of prolonged bleeding. 
-  Your baby may develop some bleeding from the intestines and the kidneys. To detect this, your 
baby’s stools and urine may be tested to determine if there is any blood present in them. 
-  Pedea may reduce the amount of urine your baby passes. If this is significant, your baby’s 
treatment may be stopped until the volume of urine returns to normal. 
-  Pedea may be less effective in very premature babies less than 27 weeks of gestational age. 
-  Serious  skin  reactions  have  been  reported  in  association  with  Pedea  treatment.  You  should  stop 
taking Pedea and seek medical attention immediately, if you develop any skin rash, lesions of the 
mucous membranes, blisters or other signs of allergy since this can be the first signs of a very serious 
skin reaction. See section 4. 
Using other medicines 
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if your baby is taking or has recently taken any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
Certain medicines, if given together with Pedea, may cause side effects. These are detailed below: 
-  
-  
-  
-  
-  
your baby may have problems passing urine and may have been prescribed diuretics. Ibuprofen 
may reduce the effect of these medicines. 
your baby may be given anticoagulants (medicine preventing blood clotting). Ibuprofen may 
increase the anti-clotting effect of this product. 
your baby may be given nitric oxide to improve blood oxygenation. Ibuprofen may increase the 
risk of bleeding. 
your baby may be given corticosteroids to prevent inflammation. Ibuprofen may increase the 
risk of bleeding in the stomach and intestines. 
your baby may be given aminosides (one family of antibiotics) to treat infection. Ibuprofen may 
increase blood concentrations and thus increase the risk of toxicity on kidney and ear 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Pedea 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (15 mg) per 2 ml, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
HOW PEDEA IS USED 
Pedea will only be given to your baby in a special neonatal intensive care unit by qualified healthcare 
professional. 
A course of therapy is defined as three intravenous injections of Pedea given at 24 hour intervals. The 
dose to be administered will be calculated from the weight of your baby. It is 10 mg/kg for the first 
administration and 5 mg/kg for the second and the third administrations. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This calculated amount will be given by infusion in a vein over a period of 15 minutes. 
If after this first course of treatment, the ductus arteriosus is not closed or re-opens, your baby’s doctor 
may decide to give a second course of treatment. 
If after the second course of treatment, the ductus arteriosus is still not closed, a surgery may then be 
proposed.

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European medicines Agency website: 
http://emea.europa.eu 
The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only: 
As for all parenteral products, ampoules of Pedea should be visually inspected for particulate matter 
and the integrity of the container prior to use. Ampoules are intended for single use only, any unused 
portions must be discarded. 
Posology and method of administration (see also section 3) 
For intravenous use only. Treatment with Pedea can only be carried out in a neonatal intensive care 
unit under the supervision of an experienced neonatologist. 
A course of therapy is defined as three intravenous doses of Pedea given at 24-hour intervals. 
The ibuprofen dose is adjusted to the body weight as follows: 
- 1st injection: 10 mg/kg, 
- 2nd and 3rd injections: 5 mg/kg. 
If the ductus arteriosus does not close 48 hours after the last injection or if it re-opens, a second course 
of 3 doses, as above, may be given. 
If the condition is unchanged after the second course of therapy, surgery of the PDA may then be 
necessary. 
If anuria or manifest oliguria occurs after the first or second dose, the next dose should be withheld 
until urine output returns to normal levels. 
Method of administration: 
Pedea should be administered as a short infusion over 15 minutes, preferably undiluted. To facilitate 
the administration an infusion pump may be used. 
If necessary, the injection volume may be adjusted with either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) 
solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection. Any unused portion of the 
solution should be discarded. 
The total volume of solution injected to preterm infants should take into account the total daily fluid 
volume administered. A maximal volume of 80 ml/kg/day on the first day of life should usually be 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
respected; this should be progressively increased in the following 1-2 weeks (about 20 ml/kg 
birthweight/day) up to a maximal volume of 180 ml/kg birthweight/day. 
Incompatibilities 
Chlorhexidine must not be used to disinfect the neck of the ampoule as it is not compatible with the 
Pedea solution. Therefore, for asepsis of the ampoule before use, ethanol 60% or isopropyl alcohol 
70% is recommended. 
When disinfecting the neck of the ampoule with an antiseptic, to avoid any interaction with the Pedea 
solution, the ampoule must be completely dry before it is opened. 
This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except sodium chloride 
9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution. 
In order to avoid any substantial variation of pH due to the presence of acidic medicinal products that 
could remain in the infusion line, the latter must be rinsed before and after administration of Pedea 
with 1.5 to 2 ml of either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/ml 
(5%) solution.

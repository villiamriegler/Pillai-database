1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and

efficacy, including all variations introduced since the

marketing authorisation was granted, the CHMP considered 
that the risk-benefit balance of Circadin in the short-term 
treatment of primary insomnia characterised by poor 
quality of sleep in patients who are aged 55 or over 
remained favourable and therefore recommended the 
renewal of the marketing authorisation. The CHMP 
recommended that the renewal be granted with unlimited 
validity.

Study 112006 was a large Randomised Clinical Trial with a 
4.2 of the SPC and section 3 of the PL) of Circadin 
based on data emerging from clinical Study 112006.  
Section 4.8 of the SPC and section 4 of the PL were 
also amended to reflect safety data from Study 
112006 and from a post-authorisation surveillance 
study carried out in the context of follow-up measure 
012 (12545A). 
The details of the MAH's representative for Romania 
have also been updated in section 6 of the PL. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
II and PL 
complex design. It analysed more than 600 patients, over 
400 of whom where on Circadin treatment for 6 months. 
The safety and efficacy data provided in Study 112006 and 
12545A support the proposed changes. In particular, the 
analysis of data from Study 112006 showed that the 
benefit observed after 3 weeks is maintained for up to 3 
months. At 3 months, about an extra 10% of responders 
were seen in the Circadin treated group. Therefore, 
melatonin treatment for longer than 3 weeks may be 
beneficial for a subgroup of patients.

This variation application was submitted to update the SPC

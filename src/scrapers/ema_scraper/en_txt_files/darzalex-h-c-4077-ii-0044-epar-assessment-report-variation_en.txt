2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed addition to the existing indication is only for the subcutaneous use of daratumumab. 
The initial proposed addition to the existing indication statement in section 4.1 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) was as follows (proposed text in bold): 
“DARZALEX is indicated in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, or as monotherapy 
for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  relapsed  and  refractory  multiple  myeloma,  whose  prior  therapy 
included  a  proteasome  inhibitor  and  an  immunomodulatory  agent  and  who  have  demonstrated  disease 
progression on the last therapy.” 
The  indication  was  entered  as  a  separate  one  from  monotherapy  and  updated  during  the  procedure  to 
better reflect the population included in study MMY3013. The following wording is agreed:  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/266131/2021 
Page 7/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“DARZALEX is indicated in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult 
patients with multiple myeloma who have received one prior therapy containing a proteasome inhibitor and 
lenalidomide  and  were  lenalidomide-refractory,  or  who  have  received  at  least  two  prior  therapies  that 
included lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on or after 
the last therapy (see section 5.1).” 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Multiple  myeloma  is  an  incurable  malignant  plasma  cell  disorder  diagnosed  annually  in  approximately 
160,000 patients worldwide (Bray 2018). The median age at diagnosis is 72 years.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
The  proliferation  of  the  malignant  clonal  plasma  cells  leads  to  subsequent  replacement  of  normal  bone 
marrow  hematopoietic precursors  and  overproduction  of  M-proteins.  Characteristic hallmarks  of  multiple 
myeloma  include  osteolytic  lesions,  anemia,  increased  susceptibility  to  infections,  hypercalcemia,  renal 
insufficiency or failure, and neurological complications (Palumbo 2011). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Multiple myeloma is characterized by osteolytic lesions, usually in the pelvis, spine, ribs, and skull. Lesions 
are  caused  by  expanding  plasmacytomas  or  by  cytokines  secreted  by  myeloma  cells  that  activate 
osteoclasts  and  suppress  osteoblasts.  Increased  bone  loss  may  also  lead  to  hypercalcemia.  Solitary 
extraosseous plasmacytomas are unusual but may occur in any tissue, especially in the upper respiratory 
tract. In many patients, renal failure is present at diagnosis or develops during the course of the disorder 
and is caused by the deposition of light chains in the distal tubules or by hypercalcemia. Patients also often 
develop anemia due to kidney disease or suppression of erythropoiesis by cancer cells, but sometimes also 
due to iron deficiency. These signs and symptoms are commonly denoted as CRAB. 
The prognosis of patients with multiple myeloma who become refractory to lenalidomide and a PI is poor, 
indicating the need for new, convenient therapeutic strategies for these patients. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Different classes of drugs are approved for multiple myeloma (alkylators, steroids, proteasome inhibitors 
[PIs],  immunomodulatory  agents  [IMiDs],  histone  deacetylase  inhibitors  [HDACIs]  and  monoclonal 
antibodies).  Among  these  treatment  options,  lenalidomide  (an  IMiD)  and  bortezomib  (a  PI)  have  a 
prominent  role.  Both  are  approved  and  used  as  frontline  treatment  of  multiple  myeloma  and  used  in 
combination with other drugs at relapse. Lenalidomide is also approved as maintenance therapy after ASCT 
in patients with NDMM. Patients who have been treated with lenalidomide and a PI are a challenge to treat 
as they have already been exposed to 2 major drug classes. Patients who relapse during ongoing treatment 
or  within  60  days  of  last  dose  of  lenalidomide  are  per  IMWG  definition  “lenalidomide  refractory”  and 
represent an additional challenge for choosing an effective subsequent treatment choice.  
Patients with exposure to lenalidomide and a PI as well as patients refractory to lenalidomide have a high 
unmet medical need, and new effective and convenient treatment options are needed (Moreau 2019). 
2.1.6.  About the product 
Daratumumab  is  a  human,  CD38-targeted,  IgG1κ  monoclonal  antibody  approved  as  monotherapy  in 
subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and in combination with standard of care regimens 
for transplant-ineligible and transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and relapsed/refractory 
Assessment report

multiple  myeloma.  The  addition  of  daratumumab  to  standard  of  care  regimens  in  Phase  3  studies  has 
consistently  improved  PFS,  resulting  in  a  benefit  that  is  both  significant  and  clinically  meaningful.  The 
addition  of  daratumumab  also  induced  higher  rates  of  deep  responses,  including  increases  in  MRD-
negativity  rates  compared  with  standard  of  care  alone.  Daratumumab  in  combination  with  the  IMiD 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Rd) resulted in a significant PFS benefit versus Rd alone in patients 
with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma with at least 1 prior line of therapy (Dimopoulos 2016). 
Recently, the daratumumab SC formulation has been approved in the European Union and United States. 
The SC administration of daratumumab provides a convenient treatment option for patients with a reduced 
incidence  of  IRRs,  decreased  administration  burden  to  both  patients  and  healthcare  professionals,  and 
reduced in-hospital time. 
2.1.7.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
No CHMP advice was sought for study MMY3013. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody and is consequently classified as a protein. According to 
the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), amino acids, peptides and proteins are exempted because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Consequently, no Environmental Risk 
Assessment for daratumumab is required. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  pharmacology  package  contains  data  from  two  combination  studies  (a  Phase  3  Study 
54767414MMY3013 and a Phase 1b Study 54767414MMY1001) that evaluated the use of DPd in subjects 
with relapsed or refractory MM (RRMM) (see Table 1).  
In addition, PK data from a phase 1b study (study MMY1001) is used as supporting data. MMY1001 is a 
multicohort  study  and  the  PK  data  come  from  the  cohort  of  subjects  who  received  daratumumab  IV  in 
combination with Pd (n=103). 
In addition to these two studies, PK data are derived from a popPK analysis (described below).  
The current work focuses on the characterization of the pharmacokinetics (PK) and exposure-response (E-
R) relationships of daratumumab SC or intravenous (IV) in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma  (RRMM)  in  combination  with  pomalidomide  and  dexamethasone  (DPd),  a  new  combination 
therapy being developed for daratumumab SC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalysis 
Validated  electro-chemiluminescent  immunoassay  (ECLIA)-based  methods  were  used  to  determine 
daratumumab concentrations and anti-daratumumab antibodies in human serum samples. A new enhanced 
drug tolerant PandA ECLIA method was used for the detection of anti-daratumumab antibodies in human 
serum in Study MMY3013. Daratumumab SC is a co-formulation of daratumumab and rHuPH20. A validated 
ECLIA  method  was  used  for  assessment  of  anti-rHuPH20  antibodies  in  human  plasma  after  SC 
administration. A validated in vitro hyaluronidase activity assay with a chromogenic readout was used to 
test for neutralising capacity. 
The cut-off date for pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity data was 06. Apr 2020 (MMY3013). 
Population PK analyses 
A previously developed (Xu, X et al, 2017 assessed in variations II/29, II/30) population pharmacokinetic 
(PPK)  model  was  used  to  characterize  the  PK  of  daratumumab  following  SC  or  IV  administration  in 
combination with dexamethasone and pomalidomide in subjects with RRMM. The PPK analysis was based 
on 1,146 daratumumab PK samples (473 SC samples and 673 IV samples) from 239 PK-evaluable subjects 
of Phase 3 Study MMY3013 (N=140) and the DPd cohort of Phase 1b Study MMY1001 (N=99). All subjects 
from  Study  MMY1001  received  daratumumab  IV  16  mg/kg.  In  Study  MMY3013,  95%  of  PK-evaluable 
subjects  (133/140)  received  daratumumab  SC  1800  mg  Seven  PK-evaluable  subjects  received 
daratumumab IV 16 mg/kg (4 subjects started daratumumab IV 16 mg/kg and switched to SC 1800 mg; 
3 subjects received IV 16 mg/kg only). The proportion of PK data below the limit of quantification of 0.2 
μg/mL was 1.5% (27/1743) and excluded from the PPK analysis. Two serum daratumumab concentrations 
were regarded as data outliers and excluded. 
The  average  baseline  characteristics  of  subjects  included in  the  PPK  analysis were  high  age  (median  66 
years),  normal  body  weight  (median  76  kg),  White  race  (84.1%),  normal  renal  function  or  mild  renal 
impairment (73.6%) and normal hepatic function (84.9%). Note that 4 subjects had body weights <50 kg 
and  3  subjects  had  body  weights  ≥120  kg.  Disease  characteristics  included  low  Eastern  Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) status (0 and 1: 92.9%), high number of prior therapies (2 and 3: 62.3%), IgG 
myeloma  (55.2%),  refractory  to  both  immunomodulatory  imide  drug  (IMiD)  and  PI  (64.9%)  and  low 
International  Staging  System  (ISS)  (1:  27.6%).  Covariate  distributions  were in  general  similar  between 
the 2 studies. Some differences between studies were apparent for ECOG status (lower in MMY3013), and 
number of prior therapies (higher in MMY1001). 
The  previous  IV/SC  2-compartment  PPK  model  with  parallel  linear  and  Michaelis-Menten  nonlinear 
elimination pathways was used to fit the serum concentration-time data of daratumumab using the first-
order conditional estimation with the interaction method in NONMEM. PsN Version 3.4.2 or higher was used 
to execute NONMEM (Nonlinear Mixed Effects Modelling) analyses. Absorption was parameterised in terms 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/266131/2021 
Page 11/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of  bioavailability  and  first-order  absorption  rate  for  SC  administration.  The  linear  CL  represents  the 
nonspecific CL for IgG and the Michaelis-Menten elimination represents the saturable target-mediated CL. 
Because of the treatment effect of daratumumab, the total target (CD38) number may decrease over time. 
This was investigated using the empirical function: 
TDVM represents the time-dependent maximum capacity of the saturable CL and KDES represents first-
order rate constant, describing the decrease of the maximum velocity of the saturable CL process over time 
(t). An additive model was used to model residual variability. 
The covariates (body weight, albumin concentration, type of myeloma [IgG versus non-IgG], and sex) that 
were previously identified were also found to be statistically significant in the PPK model (ie, the 95% CI of 
the estimated covariate effect did not include the value corresponding to no effect).  
The final model was evaluated by means of parameter estimates (Table 5), goodness-of-fit diagnostic plots 
and visual predictive checks (data not shown).

PK simulations and subgroup analyses 
Simulations were performed to graphically show the simulated daratumumab serum concentrations 
versus time and their 90% variability after SC 1800 mg and IV dosing 16 mg/kg and for sub-group 
analysis. Subgroup analysis of Ctrough,C3D1 showed that body weight, albumin concentration, and type 
of myeloma (IgG versus non-IgG) had an impact of <20% on Ctrough,C3D1.(data not shown).

In addition, target saturation versus time and its variability was simulated and plotted according to: TSAT 
= 100×(Conc×(Km+Conc)), where TSAT is the saturation ratio, Conc is the simulated daratumumab serum 
concentration and Km is the estimated Michaelis-Menten constant in the final PK model. Target saturation 
versus time was simulated based on the estimated Km of 3.81 µg/mL (95% CI 1.2-6.42) in the final Pop 
PK model.

Absorption and bioavailability 
In  the  phase  3  study  MMY3013,  a  total  of  140  subjects  were  included  for  the  assessment  of  Cmax  and 
Ctrough  of  daratumumab  as  the  PK-evaluable  population,  ie,  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of 
daratumumab and had at least 1 serum daratumumab concentration value after the first dose (SC or IV). 
Most subjects (133/140, 95%) received daratumumab SC starting from the first dose; 3 subjects received 
daratumumab IV only and 4 subjects received daratumumab IV initially and then switched to daratumumab 
SC. 
Cmax  of  daratumumab  SC  1800  mg  dosed  in  combination  with  Pd  was  consistent  with  historical  data 
following daratumumab SC 1800 mg monotherapy or in other combinations at the same dose schedule. 
Following  the  first  SC  dose  of  1800  mg  daratumumab,  the  mean±standard  deviation  (SD)  maximum 
concentration (Cycle 1 Day 4) was 138±71.2 μg/mL (Figure 2). The accumulation ratio in mean peak Cmax 
from the first dose (Cycle 1 Day 4; 138±71.2 μg/mL) to the ninth dose (Cycle 3 Day 4; 625±286 μg/mL) 
was approximately 4.5-fold.

Note: Ctrough was defined as the observed pre-dose concentration immediately before daratumumab administration; 
Cmax was defined as concentrations observed at the end-of-infusion for IV treatment or on Day 4 for SC 
administration. 
The boxplot displays a box with the 3 lines representing Q1, median (Q2), and Q3, respectively, upper whisker of 
Q3+1.5*IQR, and lower whisker of Q1-1.5*IQR. Outlier values beyond the whiskers are displayed as circles. The 
diamond inside the box represents the arithmetic mean. 
DPd-IV includes subjects with daratumumab IV only and also the IV administrations of subjects who were randomized 
to DPd group and administrated with daratumumab IV (prior to Amendment 1) and then switched to daratumumab SC 
during the study. 
DPd-SC after switch includes only the SC administrations of subjects who switched to daratumumab SC during the 
study (after Amendment 1). 
The  absorption  of  the  SC  formulation  was  modeled  as  a  first-order  absorption  process.  In  the  popPK 
analysis, Cmax following the recommended dose schedule for DPd combination therapy was determined to 
be 697 μg/mL. 
In study MMY3013, trough serum concentrations increased to the maximum Ctrough on Cycle 3 Day 1 pre-
dose (537±277 μg/mL [mean±SD]). 
Based  on  the  same  dosing  regimen  of  daratumumab  SC,  the  simulated  cycle  3  predose  Ctrough  of 
daratumumab SC as monotherapy or part of Dpd combination therapy is shown in Figure 3 below.

Peak concentrations after administration of the first SC dose (Cycle 1 Day 4) were in general comparable 
across monotherapy and combination therapies (ie, DPd and other combinations). 
In  study  MMY3013,  peak  Cmax  was  reached  on  cycle  3  day  4  and  averaged  625±286  μg/mL.  The 
accumulation ratio from the first dose was approximately 4.5-fold. The estimated bioavailability for the SC 
formulation is approximately 69%. Peak concentration after the first dose is in average reached on C1D4.  
Median cycle 3 Ctrough (predose level) of the SC 1800 mg cohort was found to be a bit higher than in the 
IV 16 mg/kg cohort, although the information from the IV data is limited by the very small sample size. 
Distribution 
From the popPK analysis, the volume of distribution of the central compartment was estimated to 4.36 L 
which is close to plasma volume. 
Elimination 
Typical clearance profiles of daratumumab SC and IV in combination with Pd is shown in Figure 5.

The estimated linear CL of 0.00432 L/h [0.104 L/day] is close to the reported CL of nonspecific endogenous 
IgG. 
The  model-derived  geometric  mean  (CV%)  half-life  associated  with  linear  elimination  was  19.7  days 
(15.3%),  comparable  to  the  estimated  half-life  derived  from  the  previous  monotherapy  of  20.4  days 
(22.4%).

Special populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
No  formal  studies  of  daratumumab in  subjects  with renal or  hepatic  function have  been  conducted.  The 
effect of renal or hepatic function on daratumumab PK for DPd has been evaluated by a popPK approach 
(pooled data from Studies MMY3013 and MMY1001, Figure 6), and no clinically relevant impact has been 
identified  for  subjects  with  mild  and  moderate  renal  or  hepatic  impairment.  As  regards  the  latter,  34 
subjects had mild and only 2 subjects had moderate hepatic impairment. There were only N=3 subjects 
with severe renal impairment and N=0 with severe hepatic impairment so it was not possible to make any 
or meaningful conclusions for these subgroups. The results are consistent with the previous results from 
daratumumab SC monotherapy.

Gender 
PopPK  simulations  (Figure  6),  based  on  post  hoc  PK  parameters,  demonstrated  that  the  simulated 
daratumumab Ctrough, C3D1 was 4% higher (95% CI: -7% to +16%) in females versus males. 
Weight 
Body weight was a statistically significant covariate identified for CL and volume of distribution in the central 
compartment of daratumumab. 
PopPK  simulations  (Figure  6),  based  on  post  hoc  PK  parameters,  demonstrated  that  simulated 
daratumumab Ctrough, C3D1 was similar in subjects with body weight <65 kg versus subjects with body weight 
≥65 kg to <85 kg, while subjects with body weight ≥85 kg had 13% (95% CI: -24% to -2%) lower Ctrough, 
C3D1 exposure when compared with those with body weight ≥65 kg to <85 kg. There was no notable impact 
of body weight on efficacy or safety during the E-R analyses.  
Age 
Approximately  45.6%  of  the  subjects  in  the  PK  analysis  dataset  were  <65  years  (N=109/239),  41.0% 
between ≥65 and <75 years (N=98/239), and 13.4% of subjects ≥75 years (N=32/239).  
PopPK  simulations  (Figure  6),  based  on  post  hoc  PK  parameters,  demonstrated  that  simulated 
daratumumab Ctrough, C3D1 was approximately 4% higher (95% CI:-8% to +17%) in subjects ≥65 and <75 
years and 16% higher (95% CI: -2% to +38%) in subjects ≥75 years, respectively, compared with subjects 
<65 years. 
Drug-drug interaction studies 
No  dedicated  drug-drug  interaction  studies  were  performed  for  daratumumab  SC.  Since  there  is  no 
overlapping  pathway  of  elimination,  no  interactions  are  expected  between  daratumumab  and  small-
molecule drugs including Pd. 
Daratumumab SC PK data in DPd combination from study MMY3013 was assessed relative to daratumumab 
SC monotherapy (study MMY3012) and the exposures were comparable. The PK profiles of small-molecule 
combination  agents  including  pomalidomide  when  dosed  in  combination  with  daratumumab  IV  (study 
MMY1001) or without daratumumab (literature value) were found to be comparable. In addition, the PK of 
daratumumab dosed SC or IV in multiple combination therapy studies were similar to SC or IV monotherapy. 
These  data  indicate  a  lack  of  PK  interaction  between  daratumumab  and  the  small-molecule  medicinal 
products tested, including the DPd combination agents of pomalidomide and dexamethasone. 
Immunogenicity 
Anti-daratumumab Antibodies 
In  the  anti-daratumumab  immunogenicity-evaluable  analysis  set,  the  cumulative  incidence  of  anti-
daratumumab antibodies was low in subjects who received daratumumab treatment in combination with 
Pd (Table below):  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/266131/2021 
Page 19/79 
 
 
 
 
Table 3 
Anti-rHuPH20 Antibodies 
In  study  MMY3013,  six  (6/122,  4.9%)  subjects  had  baseline  positive  anti-rHuPH20  samples,  and  the 
incidence of treatment-emergent anti-rHuPH20 antibodies was 7.4% (9/122) after the first daratumumab 
SC  administration,  all  non-neutralizing.  Daratumumab  exposure  was  comparable  between  subjects  with 
treatment emergent anti-rHuPH20 antibodies and those who were negative for anti-rHuPH20 antibodies. 
These data were consistent with the historical daratumumab SC findings in subjects with MM. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Daratumumab is an IgG1κ human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the CD38 protein expressed at 
a  high  level on the  surface  of  multiple  myeloma  tumour  cells,  as  well  as  other  cell types  and tissues  at 
various levels. Daratumumab has been shown to potently inhibit the in vivo growth of CD38-expressing 
tumour  cells.  Daratumumab  can  induce  tumour  cell  lysis  through  complement-dependent  cytotoxicity, 
antibody-dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity,  and  antibody-dependent  cellular  phagocytosis 
in 
malignancies expressing CD38. A subset of myeloid derived suppressor cells (CD38+MDSCs), regulatory T 
cells (CD38+Tregs) and B cells (CD38+Bregs) are decreased by daratumumab mediated cell lysis. 
Translational biomarker studies of samples from subjects treated with daratumumab in Phase 1 and Phase 
2 studies have revealed previously unknown immunomodulatory effects of daratumumab (Krejcik 2016). 
Daratumumab leads to the rapid and sustained elimination of highly immunosuppressive subsets of CD38+ 
regulatory T cells, CD38+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and CD38+ regulatory B cells (Krejcik 2016). 
The elimination of these immunosuppressive cells, modulation of CD38 enzymatic activity, and destruction 
of the malignant myeloma cells are followed by the increase in T cell clonality (Chiu 2016) and subsequent 
expansion of CD8+ and CD4+ subsets (Krejcik 2016). In particular, patients responding to daratumumab 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/266131/2021 
Page 20/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment showed an increase in the activated CD8+ T cells expressing high levels of granzyme B (Adams 
2019). Together, daratumumab’s cytotoxic and immunomodulatory mechanisms of action are hypothesized 
to synergistically result in deep anti-myeloma responses. 
Primary pharmacology 
As described in the MMY3013 CSR, addition of daratumumab SC to the treatment regimen resulted in a 
decrease in the NK cell and CD38+ regulatory T cell populations in the blood (Figure 8 below).

Exploratory exposure-response analyses 
The purpose of the Exposure response (E-R) analysis was to supplement the evidence of efficacy and safety 
of daratumumab in combination with Pd in subjects with RRMM and to confirm the selected dosing regimen.  
The final E-R dataset, used for both efficacy and safety E-R analyses, contained data from 290 subjects in 
Study MMY3013 who had received at least 1 dose of Pd (N=150) or DPd (N=140). For the DPd group, only 
subjects  with  at  least  1  evaluable  PK  concentration  were  included  in  the  final  E-R  dataset  to  be  able  to 
derive individual exposure. Subjects randomized but not receiving a dose (N=3 for Pd group, N=2 for DPd 
group) were not included. All other subjects were pooled in the E-R analysis.

Efficacy exposure-response analysis  
Three  PK  exposure  metrics  derived  by  Pop  PK  were  used  for  the  efficacy  E-R  analysis:  Cpeak,first, 
Ctrough,first, and Ctrough,max. Covariates used in the case matching analysis were selected from a set of 
predefined covariates based on a Cox proportional hazard model. 
Table 5 
The relationship between exposure and the primary efficacy endpoint PFS was investigated (Figure 9). The 
ORR  by  exposure  was  also  compared  (Figure  8).  The  relationship  between  drug  exposure  and  PFS  was 
analysed graphically using Kaplan-Meier plots.

The same trend of lower efficacy in the lowest exposure quartile is seen for PFS (Figure below):

Figure 10 
Safety exposure-response analysis 
Two PK exposure metrics were used for the safety E-R analysis: Cpeak,first for IRRs and Cpeak,max for all 
other TEAEs. The E-R relationship for selected TEAEs of clinical interest considered the safety endpoints: 
IRRs, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and infections. The TEAEs were stratified by the appropriate 
exposure  metrics  to  evaluate  whether  there  was  a  relationship  between  the  TEAEs  and  exposure  to 
daratumumab. The results were compared with those obtained from the DPd cohort of Study MMY1001. 
There was no apparent increase in TEAEs rates with increasing exposure (Cpeak,first or Cpeak,max) for IRRs, 
thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, and infections (all Grades and Grades ≥3) within the studied drug 
concentration  range  in  Study  MMY3013  (Table  6).  A  decreasing  trend  in  the  event  rate  of  neutropenia, 
anemia, and trombocytopenia was observed based on Cpeak,max (ie, a higher rate of TEAEs was observed 
in the lowest Cpeak,max at Q1). This is likely because subjects with TEAEs tended to have dose interruption 
or  delays,  which  led  to  lower  concentrations  in  these  subjects.  No  increase  in  the  rates  of  the  TEAEs 
investigated in this E-R analysis had been observed in the clinical statistical analysis with decreasing body 
weights subgroup, except for anemia. The increased anemia rate with low body weight was not related to 
an increase in exposure, as in the E-R analysis increased exposure led to lower anemia rates.

See above. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The purpose of the presented PK package is to support a new indication for SC daratumumab: combination 
treatment with daratumumab SC, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (DPd) for the treatment of patients 
with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least 1 prior line of therapy. The pharmacology package 
contains data from two combination studies; a phase 3 Study 54767414MMY3013 and a phase 1b Study 
54767414MMY1001) that evaluated the use of DPd in subjects with relapsed or refractory MM (RRMM). In 
addition,  popPK  analyses  have  been  performed.  The  analytical  methods  were  assessed  in  previous 
procedures.  The  combination  with  small  molecules  pomalidomide  and  dexamethasone  is  not  thought  to 
interfere  with  assay  performance  or  target.  Interim  reports  for  sample  analysis  conducted  in  study 
MMY1001 and MMY3013 were provided 
The  effect  of  daratumumab  is  known  from  both  an  IV  formulation  and  an  SC  formulation  used  as 
monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer medicines.  
Since an identical daratumumab SC product is already marketed and in clinical use, the primary purpose 
of the presented PK package is to a) evaluate the exposure of daratumumab SC in combination with Pd 
compared  to  daratumumab  SC  monotherapy,  b)  evaluate  efficacy  and  safety  exposure-response 
relationships  of  the  SC  DPd  regimen,  and  c)  assess  the  applicability  of  a  fixed  dose  of  daratumumab  in 
combination with Pd for the treatment of patients with MM.

In the popPK analysis, the final parameters were estimated with reasonable precision. The variability was 
large on the parameters describing the non-linear elimination and Ka. Effects of weight on clearance and 
volume  in  central  compartment  were  estimated  to  0.832  and  0.562  respectively.  Subgroup  analysis  of 
Ctrough,C3D1 showed that body weight, albumin concentration, and type of myeloma (IgG versus non-IgG) 
had an impact of <20% on Ctrough,C3D1. 
The subcutaneous DPd regimen resulted in similar plasma concentrations as observed with subcutaneous 
daratumumab monotherapy, indicating a lack of interactions between daratumumab and pomalidomide or 
dexamethasone. No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies were performed, this is acceptable.  
From the popPK analysis, the volume of distribution of the central compartment was estimated to 4.36 L 
which is close to plasma volume and similar to other mAbs. No study on protein binding has been conducted 
which is acceptable. 
The primary elimination pathways for daratumumab are clearance by the reticulo-endothelial system (in 
the same way as that for an endogenous IgG) and target-mediated elimination. Cytochrome P450 enzymes, 
efflux pumps, and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the clearance. Therefore, the potential 
risk of PK interactions between daratumumab and other drugs is low.  
As  regards  special  populations,  no  clinically  relevant  impact  of  sex,  age,  or  weight  on  the  PK  of 
daratumumab has been reported. Mild to moderate renal and hepatic impairment do not seem to affect the 
PK of SC daratumumab.   
The incidence of treatment emergent anti-daratumumab antibodies (1.6%) and anti-rHuPH20 antibodies 
(approximately 8%) is similar to previous reports, indicating a low risk of immunogenicity of daratumumab 
when combined with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in subjects with MM.   
Evaluation of efficacy exposure-response relationship indicated a similar effect in the three upper (Q2-Q4) 
exposure  quartiles  and  a  lower  effect  for  the  Q1  subgroup  on  both  PFS  and  ORR.  The  safety  exposure-
response  relationship  showed  no  apparent  increase  in  TEAEs  rate  with  increasing  daratumumab  SC 
exposure,  indicating  that  the  obtained  exposure  levels  overall  do  not  exceed  the  tolerability  threshold. 
These exposure-response results, together with the daratumumab plasma concentration obtained, similar 
to daratumumab SC monotherapy, indicate that the fixed 1800 mg dose in combination with pomalidomide 
and dexamethasone is applicable and reasonable.       
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  pharmacology  program  consists  of  one  pivotal  and  one  supportive  study  as  well  as  pop  PK 
analyses. Based on the comprehensive existing knowledge of daratumumab, the pharmacology package is 
considered  adequate  to  support  the  application  of  an  extension  of  indication  and  the  proposed  dosing 
regimen  of  subcutaneous  daratumumab  in  combination  with  pomalidomide  and  dexamethasone  for  the 
treatment of MM.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
The present application concerns a fixed dose of daratumumab SC, which has previously been established: 
The  effect  of  daratumumab  is  known  from  both  an  IV  formulation  and  an  SC  formulation  used  as 
monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer medicines.  See also section  2.1.1. regarding the

squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast, or other non-
invasive lesion that in the opinion of the investigator, with concurrence with the Sponsor's medical monitor, 
is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence within 3 years). 
6. Clinical signs of meningeal involvement of MM. 
7.  Chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  with  a  Forced  Expiratory  Volume  in  1  second  (FEV1) 
<50% of predicted normal. Note that FEV1 testing is required for subjects suspected of having COPD and 
subjects must be excluded if FEV1 <50% of predicted normal. (Appendix 4). 
8. Clinically significant cardiac disease, including: 
a)  Myocardial  infarction  within  6  months  before  C1D1,  or  unstable  or  uncontrolled  condition  (eg, 
unstable angina, congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association Class III-IV). 
b)  Cardiac arrhythmia (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade 3 or higher) 
or clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities. 
c)  Electrocardiogram showing a baseline QT interval as corrected QTc >470 msec. 
9. Ongoing ≥Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy. 
10. Subject had ≥Grade 3 rash during prior therapy. 
Treatments 
Subjects randomized to the DPd group received daratumumab (1800 mg Dara SC or 16 mg/kg Dara IV 
[prior to Amendment 1]) at weekly intervals for 8 weeks, then every 2 weeks for 16 weeks (Cycles 3-6), 
then every 4 weeks (from Cycle 7 and beyond). Subjects in both treatment arms received pomalidomide 
at a dose of 4 mg PO on Days 1 through 21 of each 28-day cycle, and dexamethasone at a total dose of 40 
mg PO once a week (20 mg for subjects ≥75 years). 
Figure 12: Dosing and Administration in Study MMY3013 
Subjects were to continue to receive study treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
Dose delay was permitted and was the primary method for managing daratumumab-related toxicities as 
described in detail in the protocol . Subjects received pre- and post-dose medications to prevent IRRs and, 
if applicable, respiratory complications. 
According to the study protocol treatment would have been withhold if any of the following criteria were 
met, to allow for recovery from toxicity, regardless of relationship to study drug: 
•  Grade 4 haematologic toxicity, except for Grade 4 lymphopenia 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/266131/2021 
Page 29/79 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia 
• 
Febrile neutropenia 
•  Neutropenia with infection, of any grade 
•  Grade 3 or higher non-haematologic toxicities with the following exceptions:  
o  Grade 3 nausea that responds to antiemetic treatment within 7 days 
o  Grade 3 vomiting that responds to antiemetic treatment within 7 days 
o  Grade 3 diarrhea that responds to antidiarrheal treatment within 7 days 
o  Grade  3  fatigue  that  was  present  at  baseline  or  that  lasts  for  <7  days  after  the  last 
administration of daratumumab 
o  Grade  3  asthenia  that  was  present  at  baseline  or  that  lasts  for  <7  days  after  the  last 
administration of daratumumab 
Study treatment would be resumed when the toxicity had resolved to ≤Grade 2. If study drug administration 
did  not  commence  within  the  prespecified  window  of  the  scheduled  administration  date,  then  the  dose 
would be considered a missed dose. Administration could be resumed at the next planned dosing date. A 
missed dose would not be made up. 
Objectives 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the addition of daratumumab to pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary objective of this study was to compare PFS between treatment arms:  
The time, in months, from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented disease 
progression (based on a validated computer algorithm using modified IMWG criteria [Durie 2006, 
Rajkumar 2011]) or death due to any cause, whichever comes first 
Key secondary efficacy objectives were: 
• 
• 
• 
To compare ORR between treatment arms: The proportion of randomized subjects who achieve a 
best response of PR or better (ie, sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR) based on a validated computer algorithm 
using the modified IMWG criteria 
To compare OS between treatment arms: The time, in months, from the date of randomization to 
the date of death from any cause 
To assess the depth of response by analyzing MRD negativity rate for confirmed or suspected CR 
or better: The proportion of subjects who have negative MRD at any timepoint after the date of 
randomization (threshold value of 10-5) 
The  primary  analysis  of  efficacy  variables  associated  with  response/progression  will  be  performed  using 
response or disease progression as derived from a validated computer algorithm according to the modified 
IMWG criteria. 
Sample size 
Approximately 302 subjects (151 per arm) were planned to be randomized in this study. The sample size 
calculation was based on the primary endpoint PFS, at a one-sided significance level of 0.025, assuming 
exponential survival distribution with a HR of 0.621 (DPd versus Pd). A total of 280 evaluable subjects (140 
per  arm)  was  required  to  observe  188  events  to  test  the  hypothesis  with  90%  power.  The  sample  size 
calculation has taken into consideration 7% rate for permanent early censoring before the study cut-off, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/266131/2021 
Page 30/79 
 
 
 
 
and 1 interim analysis to assess superiority potentially at an early timepoint (ie, approximately 113 [60% 
of total planned events] PFS events observed). 
Long-term survival follow-up is to continue until 166 deaths have been observed or 5 years after the last 
subject  was  randomized,  whichever  comes  first.  The  study  was  planned  to  achieve  approximately  70% 
power to detect a 34% reduction in the risk of death (HR=0.66; DPd versus Pd) with a log-rank test (one-
sided alpha=0.025). 
The sample size has taken into consideration one interim analysis to assess superiority potentially at an 
early timepoint (i.e. approximately 113 (60% of total planned events) PFS events observed). 
Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to receive either DPd or Pd via the IWRS provider using a 
validated system. Randomization was stratified by the number of lines of prior therapy (1, 2-3, ≥4) and 
ISS stage (1, 2, 3). 
Blinding (masking) 
Study MMY3013 was an open-label study.  
Statistical methods 
Primary endpoint PFS 
The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  a  stratified  log-rank  test  for  the  comparison  of  the  PFS  distribution 
between the 2 treatment arms. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the distribution of overall 
PFS  for  each  treatment.  The  treatment  effect  (hazard  ratio)  and  its  two-sided  95%  CIs  were  estimated 
using a stratified Cox regression model with treatment as an explanatory variable, stratified by ISS staging 
(1, 2, 3), and number of lines of prior therapy (1, 2-3, ≥4).

Sensitivity analyses for PFS 
• 
PFS based on investigator assessment of disease progression. 
•  Censored for death/PD after missing more than one disease evaluations. 
•  Censored for death due to COVID-19 without PD 
Secondary endpoints: Response rate (ORR, VGPR or better, CR or better) 
The  overall  response  rate,  along  with  its  exact  two-sided  95%  CI  (obtained  from  the  Clopper-Pearson 
method),  would  be  computed  within  each  treatment  group.  Overall  response  rate  would  be  compared 
between  treatment  groups  using  a  stratified  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  (CMH)  chi-squared  test.  The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/266131/2021 
Page 31/79 
 
 
 
 
  
stratification factor is that used in the randomization, i.e., number of lines of prior therapy (1, 2-3, ≥4) and 
ISS stage (1, 2, 3). The CMH estimate of odds ratio and its two-sided 95% CI for the difference in overall 
response rates between treatment groups will be reported. 
For  the  response  rates,  subjects  discontinuing  before  reaching  a  response  would  be  considered  as  non-
responders. 
A sensitivity analysis of ORR would be performed based on the investigator assessment of response. 
A  supplementary  analysis  of  ORR  would  be  conducted  by  excluding  those  subjects  who  already  began 
treatment with Dara IV prior to Amendment 1 on the ITT Set. 
Secondary endpoint: Minimal Residual Disease Negativity Rate 
The MRD negativity rate would be calculated for each treatment group based. The corresponding 95% exact 
CI  would  be  provided.  For  each  threshold  value,  Fisher’s  exact  test  would  be  used  to  test  if  the  MRD 
negativity rate is the same between the two treatment groups. For the purpose of hierarchical testing, the 
threshold value of 10-5 will be employed. 
MRD  positive  subjects  include  subjects  of  which  all  tested  samples  were  found  to  be  MRD  positive,  or 
ambiguous, or subjects who were not tested. 
As  sensitive  analyses,  the  MRD  negativity  and  CR  or  better  rate  based  on  ITT  population  would  be 
calculated. 
Secondary endpoint: OS 
OS in months will be analyzed similarly to PFS. 
For subject who withdraw consent from study, if death information is recorded in the clinical database, the 
death reported after withdrawal will be considered as OS event. Subjects who have not died at the cut-off 
date for the final analysis will be censored at the last known alive date. The date of last known alive will be 
determined by the maximum collection/assessment date within the clinical database. 
A  sensitivity  analysis  of  OS  will  be  conducted  using  an  unstratified  Cox  proportional  hazard  model  with 
treatment  arm  as  single  factor.  OS  will  be  compared  between  treatment  groups  using  the  log  rank  test 
(unstratified). 
Interim analyses and multiplicity issues 
An interim analysis was planned when approximately 113 PFS events occurred (60% of the total planned 
events). Efficacy testing boundaries of PFS at interim analysis and primary analysis were determined using 
the pre-specified alpha-spending function described by Lan and DeMets which approximated the boundaries 
of O’Brien and Fleming.  For OS, a modified linear alpha spending function will be used, i.e., the alpha to 
be spent on the interim efficacy analysis (113 PFS event, which is 60% of the total planned PFS events) is 
0.0001 (1-sided), a total alpha of 0.0001 (1-sided) will be spent. The major secondary hypotheses are to 
be  tested  at  the  nominal  0.025  (1-sided)  significance  level  by  utilizing  a  sequential,  hierarchical  testing 
approach  as  proposed  by  Tang  and  Geller  (1999)  that  strongly  controls  Type  I  error  rate.  The  major 
secondary endpoints are ordered as follows: 
1) ORR 
2) Rate of VGPR or better 
3) Rate of CR or better 
4) MRD negativity rate 
5) Overall survival 
If the testing of the primary endpoint of PFS is statistically significant, these major secondary endpoints 
ordered above will be sequentially tested, each with an overall one-sided alpha of 0.025. The significance 
level at the interim analysis will be determined by the alpha-spending function specific to that endpoint.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: PFS 
At a median overall follow-up of 16.9 months (DPd: 17.5 months; Pd: 16.4 months), the addition of 
daratumumab SC to Pd resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS, 
with a 37% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared with Pd alone (HR=0.63; 
95% CI: 0.47, 0.85; 2-sided p=0.0018; Table 15 and Figure 13).  
The median PFS and 95% CI was 12.4 months (8.3, 19.3) for the DPd treatment group and 6.9 months 
(5.5, 9.3) for the Pd treatment group. 
Most  PFS  events  were  attributed  to  disease  progression  (46.4%  in  the  DPd  group  and  61.4%  in  the  Pd 
group). Data from 44.4% of subjects in the DPd group and 30.7% of subjects in the Pd group were censored 
for the primary endpoint analysis. The majority of these subjects were censored due to clinical cut-off. No 
subjects were censored for death due to COVID-19 without disease progression.

Subgroup Analyses of Progression-free Survival 
The PFS results were generally consistent across subgroups demonstrating improvement for subjects 
in the DPd group compared with subjects in the Pd group, including subgroups for subjects refractory to 
lenalidomide,  high-risk  cytogenetics,  ISS  staging,  number  of  lines  of  prior  therapy,  and  baseline  ECOG 
performance score (Figure 4).  
No analyses were performed for extreme high body weight as too few subjects were available (no subjects 
in the DPd group and 1 subject in Pd group weighed >120 kg at baseline).  
All “number of prior therapies” subgroups consistently favoured DPd, including subjects with only 1 prior 
line of therapy.

Overall Survival 
With a median overall follow-up of 16.9 months (DPd: 17.5 months; Pd: 16.4 months; Attachment T14.02-
08.01),  median  OS  was  not  reached  in  either  treatment  group  (see  Table  and  Figure  below).  Similar 
numbers of deaths were observed for DPd and Pd treatment groups (DPd: 48 [31.8%]; Pd: 51 [33.3%]), 
with an HR=0.91 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.35; 2-sided p=0.6359). The participants will continue to be followed up 
for the OS data until 166 deaths have been observed or 5 years after the last subject was randomized.

Supportive study 
Study  MMY1001  was  a  Phase  1b  open-label,  non-randomized,  multicenter  study  to  evaluate  the  safety, 
tolerability,  and  dose  regimen  of  daratumumab  IV  when  administered  in  combination  with  various 
background treatment regimens for multiple myeloma in either newly diagnosed patients or those who had 
received  prior  therapies,  depending  on  the  background  treatment  regimen.  The  treatment  regimens 
combined  with  daratumumab  IV  in  this  study  included  regimens  used  for  newly  diagnosed  patients  (ie, 
VELCADE-dexamethasone 
[VMP],  VELCADE-thalidomide-
dexamethasone  [VTd],  carfilzomib  +  lenalidomide  +  dexamethasone  [KRd]  and  regimens  used  for 
previously treated patients (ie, Pd, and carfilzomib-dexamethasone [Kd]. Among relapsed and refractory 
subjects, 1 cohort, daratumumab IV in combination with Pom-dex (DPd), was expanded to 103 subjects to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of DPd. Efficacy data from this DPd cohort is summarized below. 
[Vd],  VELCADE-melphalan-prednisone 
Figure 16: Schematic Overview of Study MMY1001
The  primary  objective  for  the  DPd  cohort  was  to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  and  dosing  of 
daratumumab IV in combination with Pd when administered to subjects with multiple myeloma who had 
received ≥2 prior lines of therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR, defined as the proportion of 
subjects with PR or better. Secondary efficacy endpoints included DOR, TTR, TTP, PFS, and OS.  Efficacy 
assessment was performed in accordance with IMWG guidelines (Durie 2006; Rajkumar 2011). The primary 
analysis was based on response assessed by an IDSMB; investigator assessment and algorithm assessment 
were performed as sensitivity analyses. 
One hundred three (103) subjects were enrolled in the DPd cohort with median age of 64 years (range: 
35-86 years), with 50% of subjects ≥65 years of age and 55% of subjects were male. A majority of subjects 
had an ECOG status score of 0-1 (88%). All subjects in the DPd cohort received prior therapy for multiple 
myeloma. The majority of subjects (51%) received >3 lines of prior multiple myeloma therapy; median 
number of prior therapies was 4. Ninety-eight percent of subjects had previous exposure to both bortezomib 
and lenalidomide.

As of the clinical cut-off, median duration of study treatment for the 103 subjects in the DPd cohort was 
6.0  months  (range:  0-17  months).  Median  relative  dose  intensity  was  97%  for  daratumumab,  78%  for 
pomalidomide and 90% for dexamethasone.  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint – Overall Response Rate 
The ORR (PR or better) based on IDSMB assessment was 59.2%, with 42% of subjects having a rate of 
VGPR or better and 14% of subjects having a rate of CR or better.

Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Based on IDSMB assessment of response, median DOR was 13.6 months for responders (61 subjects) in 
the response-evaluable cohort. Estimated DOR was 84% at 6 months, and 67% at 12 months.  
Based on IDSMB assessment, time to response (61 subjects) in the response-evaluable cohort was as 
follows. Median time to first response (PR or better) was 0.99 months; median time to best response (PR 
or better) was 2.1 months; median time to VGPR or better response (43 subjects) was 1.9 months; and 
median time to CR or better response (14 subjects) was 5.4 months.  
Based on IDSMB assessment, 49 (48%) PFS events were observed; median PFS was 10.4 months (CI: 
4.63,  NE).  Three-month  disease  progression-free  rate  was  74%;  6-month  disease  progression-free  rate 
was 57%; and 12-month disease progression-free rate was 45%.

Based  on IDSMB  assessment,  42  (41%)  TTP  events  were  observed;  median TTP  was  10.9  months  (CI: 
6.70,  NE).  Three-month  disease  progression-free  rate  was  78%;  6-month  disease  progression-free  rate 
was 62%; and 12-month disease progression-free rate was 48%. 
At the clinical data cut-off, with a median follow-up of 9.8 months, 28 deaths (27%) were observed and 75 
subjects (73%) were censored. Median survival was not estimable. Estimated survival rates were 89% at 
3 months; 79% at 6 months; and 72% at 12 months.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The current submission is supported by study MMY3013, which is a Phase 3 study comparing pomalidomide 
and dexamethasone with or without daratumumab in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma 
who have received at least one prior line of therapy with both lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. 
The proposed daratumumab SC dose is the same proposed as part of other drug-combinations. Safety and 
tolerability data have been generated with IV daratumumab in combination with Pd in the DPd cohort of 
study MMY1001 and confirmed in the phase 3 randomized clinical study MMY3013 (where daratumumab 
was given subcutaneously). The view of the Applicant that no additional dose studies need to be conducted 
is supported. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The purpose of the pivotal phase 3 study MMY3013 was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DPd to Pd in 
subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma having received prior lenalidomide and an IMiD (96% 
had received bortezomib) using the primary endpoint of PFS based on IMWG criteria.  
Daratumumab was given SC (7 patients received IV before amendment 2). Pd dose was given according to 
Imnovid SmPC. Treatment continued until PD or unacceptable toxicity.  
Subjects  were  randomized  1:1  to  DPd  or  Pd.  Randomization  was  stratified  by  number  of  lines  of  prior 
therapy and ISS stage. The study was open-label. An IDMC conducted the interim analysis.  
The primary population for the efficacy analysis is the ITT, which includes all randomized subjects. This is 
endorsed. PFS  was analysed using a stratified log-rank test and the hazard ratio was estimated using a 
stratified  Cox  model.  In  both  cases,  the  stratification  factors  were  those  used  at  randomisation.  The 
implementation of a stratified log-rank test and a stratified Cox model is endorsed. The censoring rules are 
not fully agreed, since censoring due to start of a subsequent therapy before PD or withdrawal of consent 
could bias the results. However, the MAH presented sensitivity analyses, which yielded similar results as 
those corresponding to the primary analysis. 
An interim analysis for PFS with the possibility of stopping for superiority was planned. To control the type 
I  error  due  to  multiple  looks,  alpha  spending  functions  were  used.  There  are  several  key  secondary 
endpoints, which were to be tested using a pre-define hierarchical approach. The implemented strategy to 
control for multiplicity issues is agreed. 
The baseline characteristics including disease characteristics and prior treatment were generally comparable 
between the two arms in study 3013.  
Subjects received a median of 2 prior lines of therapy, with approximately 11% of subjects receiving 1 prior 
line of therapy. The MAH is applying for DPd after at least one prior therapy as long as the “prior therapy 
included a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent”.     
The  indication  sought  is  for  patients  having  received  a  prior  PI  and  IMiD.  All  patients  had  received 
lenalidomide (this was an inclusion criterion) and 96% of patients had received prior bortezomib treatment. 
The fact that all patients received lenalidomide has now been reflected in the indication (instead of IMiD), 
also in line with other approved products. Thirty percent of patients had also received thalidomide, and for 
the PI category approximately 25% had received carfilzomib and 11% ixazomib (in the DPd arm). Based

on that and to better reflect the study population the CHMP considered that the most appropriate indication 
would be  
“DARZALEX is indicated in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult 
patients  with  multiple  myeloma  who  have  received  one  prior  therapy  containing  a  proteasome 
inhibitor  and  lenalidomide  and  were lenalidomide-refractory,  or  who  have  received  at  least two  prior 
therapies  that  included  lenalidomide  and  a  proteasome  inhibitor  and  have  demonstrated  disease 
progression on or after the last therapy (see section 5.1). 
Supportive data where derived from 103 DPd-treated patients in the phase 1b study MMY1001, which was 
an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and dose regimen of 
daratumumab  IV  when  administered  in  combination  with  various  background  treatment  regimens  for 
multiple myeloma in either newly diagnosed patients or those who had received prior therapies, depending 
on the background treatment regimen.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A  total  of  304  subjects  (DPd:  151,  Pd:  153)  were  randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  according  to  planned 
stratification factors (number of lines of prior therapy and ISS staging), and 299 subjects (DPd: 149, Pd: 
150) received study treatment. At the time of the clinical cut-off date of 21 July 2020, 40.3% DPd subjects 
and 22% of Pd subjects were still on study treatment. 
Treatment discontinuations were higher in the Pd group compared with the experimental arm, (78% in Pd 
arm  vs.  59.73%  in  the  DPd  arm).  Differences  appear  mainly  driven  by  the  higher  rate  of  treatment 
discontinuation in the Pd arm due to progressive disease (Pd: 58%; DPd: 44.3%), which is not unexpected 
considering  the  reported  efficacy  data  of  the  study.  A  low  proportion  of  subjects  discontinued  study 
treatment due to death (DPd: 6.7%; Pd: 4.7%; including 1 death due to COVID-19 in the DPd group), non-
compliance with study drug (DPd: 3.4%; Pd: 8%), and AE (DPd: 2%; Pd: 2.7%). 
Demographic characteristics were well balanced between the 2 treatment groups. The median age was 67 
years (range: 35 to 90 years), with 18.4% of the subjects ≥75 years of age. The majority of the subjects 
were white (89.5%) and had an ECOG performance score of 0 or 1 (91.8%). 
Of note, an imbalance between treatment arms is noted for patients with worse general condition (i.e. 6 
vs. 19 patients with ECOG PS2 in the DPd and Pd arms, respectively) and in patients over 75 years of age 
(i.e. 25 vs. 31 patients in the DPd and Pd arms, respectively). Both are small subgroups.  
Baseline disease characteristics. The majority of subjects had measurable disease in serum only (55.9%) 
with  IgG  (41.1%)  and  IgA  (14.5%).  Approximately  25%  of  ITT  subjects  (35%  of  those  with  available 
information  [DPd:  37.9%;  Pd:  32.4%])  had  a  high-risk  cytogenetic  abnormality  (presence  of  del17p, 
t[14;16] or t[4;14]). The distribution of ISS stages (a stratification factor at randomization) was balanced 
between treatment groups, with 45.1% of subjects overall reported as Stage 1, 33.2% as Stage 2, and 
21.7% as Stage 3. When subjects were additionally assessed according to revised ISS (R-ISS) criteria (i.e. 
those with available information; n=246), a higher proportion of R-ISS Stage 3 was reported in the DPd 
group (16%) compared with the Pd group (11%). 
The types of prior therapies for MM were consistent with standard of care for the population enrolled in the 
study and similar between treatment groups. All subjects were previously treated with both lenalidomide 
and a PI, and >95% of subjects were previously treated with bortezomib therapy. 
Subjects received a median of 2 prior lines of therapy, with approximately 11% of subjects receiving 1 prior 
line of therapy. Eighty percent of subjects were refractory to lenalidomide, 48% subjects were refractory 
to a PI, and 42.4% subjects were refractory to both PI and IMiD. For subjects who received only 1 prior 
line of therapy, all were refractory to lenalidomide and 32.4% were double refractory to both a PI and an 
IMiD.

At  a  median  overall  follow-up  of  16.9  months  (DPd:  17.5  months;  Pd:  16.4  months)  the  addition  of 
daratumumab SC to Pd resulted in a statistically significant improvement in PFS with a 37% reduction in 
the risk of disease progression or death compared with Pd alone (HR=0.63; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.85; 2-sided 
p=0.0018,). The median PFS was 12.4 months for the DPd treatment group (95% CI; 8.3, 19.3) and 6.9 
months for the Pd treatment group (95% CI; 5.5, 9.3), which is considered clinically relevant particularly 
in a population that had received a median of 2 prior treatments that included lenalidomide and a PI. Most 
PFS events were attributed to disease progression (46.4% in the DPd group and 61.4% in the Pd group). 
Data from 44.4% of subjects in the DPd group and 30.7% of subjects in the Pd group were censored for 
the  primary  endpoint  analysis.  The  majority  of  these  subjects  were  censored  due  to  clinical  cut-off.  No 
subjects were censored for death due to COVID-19 without disease progression. No patients had received 
prior  anti-CD38-containing  therapy.  The  MAH  has  agreed  with  the  recommendation  to  provide  the  final 
study report for Study MMY3013, estimated to be available by approximately Q4 2022.  
Sensitivity  analyses  supported  the  findings  of  the  primary  analysis.  PFS  results  were  also  generally 
consistent across subgroups though interpretation of the results in some of them is limited by the small 
sample size, e.g. ‘non-white’ race, ≥4 and 1 prior lines of therapy, R-ISS Stage 3, and baseline impaired 
hepatic function. Of note, according to the HRs reported, there is some uncertainty that patients pertaining 
to the R-ISS Stage 3 group and those with impaired hepatic function would derive benefit from the addition 
of daratumumab to Pd. It is acknowledged that the confidence intervals are wide and the number of patients 
low. 
Key secondary endpoints 
DPd showed a statistically significant higher ORR compared with the Pd group (DPd: 68.9%; Pd: 46.4%); 
the stratified CMH estimate of odds ratio was 2.68 with 95% CI (1.65, 4.35) and 2-sided p<0.0001. The 
median duration of response had not been reached in the D-Pd group (range: 1 to 34.9+ months) and 
was 15.9 months (range: 1+ to 24.8 months) in the Pd group. 
DPd also showed a statistically significant higher rate of CR (sCR and CR) or better compared with the Pd 
group (DPd: 24.5%; Pd: 3.9%; stratified CMH odds ratio=8.24 with 95% CI: [3.35, 20.26]; p<0.0001.  
The MRD negativity rate at the sensitivity threshold of 105 was 8.6% for  DPd and 2.0% for Pd (odds 
ratio=4.71; 95% CI: 1.31, 16.88; 2-sided p=0.0102).  
There is a statistical relationship between the achievement of complete response (CR), MRD negativity and 
PFS or OS (ESMO guidelines; Moreau et al., 2017), and thus the higher CR and MRD-negativity rates in the 
DPd arm are considered clinically important responses. 
OS data are still immature. The MAH has agreed to provide updated survival data in the final study report 
for Study MMY3013, estimated to be available by approximately Q4 2022. 
Supportive study MMY1001  
Comparing  studies  3013  and  1001  is  difficult  due  to  different  patient  populations,  objectives,  primary 
endpoints, daratumumab treatment durations, formulation (IV vs SC), and follow-up times. Generally, the 
results support study MMY3013.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The addition of daratumumab to the combination of pomalidomide and dexamethasone translates into a 
significant  delay  in  the  progression  of  the  disease  in  the  targeted  patient  population,  i.e.  patients  with 
multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior line of therapy with both lenalidomide, to which 
80% were refractory, and a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and had demonstrated disease progression. 
This  benefit  in  terms  of  PFS  is  supported  by  several  secondary  endpoints.  Importantly,  despite  the 
immaturity of the OS data, no evidence of detrimental effects on survival has so far been observed. 
To better reflect the study population the CHMP considered that the most appropriate indication would be:

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety population consists of data from 299 treated subjects from the Phase 3 Study MMY3013 (DPd: 
149;  Pd:  150).  In  addition,  supportive  safety  data  from  Study  MMY1001,  a  Phase  1b  evaluation  of 
daratumumab administered in combination with Pd (N=103), are summarized in the Efficacy section. 
As of the clinical cut-off date of 21 July 2020, 304 subjects were randomized into Study MMY3013. Of these, 
299 subjects were treated (DPd: 149 subjects; Pd: 150 subjects) and represents the Safety Analysis Set. 
At the time of the clinical cut-off date, 60 subjects (40.3%) in the DPd group and 33 subjects (22.0%) in 
the Pd group were still receiving study treatment. 
In  Study  MMY1001,  57.3%  of  subjects  discontinued  treatment  [PD  (33.0%),  AEs  (13.6%),  physician 
decision (3.9%), death (1.9%), and other (1%)].  
Patient exposure 
In study 3013 the median duration of treatment for subjects in the DPd group (11.5 months) was 1.7 times 
that of the Pd group (6.6 months). The median number of treatment cycles received was 12 in the DPd 
group and 7 in the Pd group (Table 21). 
The median daratumumab relative dose intensity in Study MMY3013 was 93.6%. The median relative dose 
intensity was lower in the DPd group for pomalidomide (74.3%) and dexamethasone (83.3%) compared 
with the Pd group (91.1% and 87.5%, respectively).

Key: Pd = pomalidomide - dexamethasone; DPd = daratumumab - pomalidomide - dexamethasone; SC = subcutaneous. 
TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event; NCI CTCAE = National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. 
"DPd" includes all subjects who received daratumumab, regardless of the route of administration, with pomalidomide and dexamethasone. 
Each subject could have more than one event, and multiple occurrences of each event, but is only counted once for each row 
a. TEAEs related to at least 1 of the 3 study treatments: pomalidomide, dexamethasone or daratumumab. Study treatment-related TEAEs 
are the TEAEs with relationship recorded on the case report form as "definitely related", "probably related", and "possibly related". If the 
relationship to a study treatment is missing, the TEAE is considered treatment-related as well 
b. For each subject and each adverse event, the maximum toxicity grade is selected. Adverse events were graded according to NCI 
CTCAE version 4.03. 
c. Includes those subjects indicated as having discontinued treatment due to an adverse event on the End of Treatment case report form. 
Adverse events are reported using MedDRA version 23.0. 
Percentages are calculated with the number of subjects in each group as denominator 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
In Study MMY3013, the most frequently reported (≥20%) daratumumab-related TEAE as assessed by the 
investigator  was  neutropenia  (28.9%).  The  most  frequently  reported  pomalidomide-related  TEAEs  were 
neutropenia (DPd: 65.1%; Pd: 48.7%), thrombocytopenia (DPd: 22.8%; Pd: 22.0%), and leukopenia (DPd: 
22.2%; Pd: 9.3%). 
Most common ADRs with at least 5% greater incidence in the DPd Arm are summarised in Table 23. 
Table 27: Adverse Reactions Reported in at Least 10% of Subjects in the DPd Arm With at Least 5% 
Greater Incidence in the DPd Arm; Safety Analysis Set (Study 54767414MMY3013) 
A review of Study MMY3013 identified the new ADR term of syncope which now meets the pre-defined ADR 
threshold (reported in ≥10% of subjects and occurred at a higher incidence (≥5% difference) in the DPd 
treatment group as compared with the Pd). 
The incidence of syncope was higher in the DPd group compared to the Pd group (DPd: 6.7%; Pd: 0.7%) . 
All cases were Grade 2 or Grade 3, and all recovered. Syncope was reported as a serious TEAE in only the 
DPd group (2.0%) (Table 27). These cases were confounded by medical history, including cardiac disorders 
and/or dehydration/procedures contributing to the events of syncope. However, daratumumab contribution 
to these events could not be excluded.

Other significant adverse events 
Infusion-related Reactions (IRR) 
IRRs were defined as systemic reactions related to daratumumab administration, regardless of the route of 
administration. IRRs were recorded by the investigator in the eCRF. 
In  Study  MMY3013,  7  of  149  subjects  received  daratumumab  IV  administration  prior  to  Protocol 
Amendment 1. IRRs were reported for 5.4% of subjects in the DPd group, with pyrexia as the most common 
preferred term reported by subjects (2.0%). None of the 7 subjects starting treatment with daratumumab 
IV experienced IRRs. All IRRs reported occurred in subjects treated with daratumumab SC only. All IRRs 
reported were Grade 1 or 2, and none resulted in discontinuation or interruption of treatment. 
Injection-site reactions (ISR) 
Localized  reactions  at  the  site  of  administration  of  daratumumab  SC  were  referred  to  as  injection-site 
reactions. 
Injection-site reactions were reported for 3 subjects (2.0%) in the DPd group. The following preferred terms 
were experienced as Grade 1 for 1 subject each: erythema, rash, and contusion. None of these resulted in 
discontinuation or interruption of treatment.  
Cytopenia AEs 
The  addition  of  daratumumab  to  Pd  in  Study  MMY3013  resulted  in  higher  incidences  of  neutropenia, 
lymphopenia, and febrile neutropenia compared to subjects receiving Pd alone. Overall, the incidence of 
cytopenia-related events was higher in the DPd group (84.6%) compared to the Pd group (78.0%).

Haemorrhagic Events 
The  incidence  of  haemorrhagic  events  was  balanced  between  the  treatment  groups  in  Study  MMY3013 
(DPd: 4.0%; Pd: 6.0%), and the majority of events were Grade 1 or 2. One subject in the DPd group (anal 
haemorrhage)  and  2  subjects  in the  Pd  group  (gastrointestinal  haemorrhage and  epistaxis)  experienced 
Grade  3  events  and  one  subject  in  the  Pd  group  experienced  a  Grade  5  event  (cerebral  haemorrhage) 
resulting in death.  
Two subjects (1.3%) in the DPd group and 2 subjects in the Pd group (1.3%) in Study MMY3013 received 
fresh frozen plasma transfusions.  
The incidence of haemorrhagic events was higher (25.2%) in Study MMY1001 compared to Study MMY3013.  
Infections and infestations 
Subjects in the DPd group had a higher incidence of any grade TEAE of infection (DPd: 70.5%; Pd: 55.3%; 
Table 24). Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs of infections were reported in 28.2% of subjects in the DPd group and 22.7% 
of  subjects  in  the  Pd  group  (Table  25).  The  most  common  (≥5%)  Grade  3  or  4  infections  included 
pneumonia (DPd: 13.4%; Pd: 6.7%) and lower respiratory tract infection (DPd: 11.4%; Pd: 9.3%). 
Second primary malignancies (SPM) 
The rate of SPMs was balanced in both treatment groups in Study MMY3013 (DPd: 2.0%; Pd: 2.0%). A 
haematologic  SPM  was  reported  for  1  subject  in  the  Pd  group  (acute  myeloid  leukemia).  No  single 
malignancy predominated.  
No SPMs were reported in Study MMY1001.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Consistent  with  the  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  cytopenia  events  in  Study  MMY3013,  Grade  4 
haematology  values  of  low  WBC  (DPd:  21.6%;  Pd:  4.0%),  low  platelets  (DPd:  10.1%;  Pd:  6.7%),  low 
neutrophils  (DPd:  48.0%;  Pd:  20.1%),  and  low lymphocytes  (DPd:  15.5%;  Pd:  3.4%)  were  reported  at 
higher incidences in subjects from the DPd group compared with the Pd group. Grade 3 haematology values 
of low haemoglobin were reported for 16.2% of subjects in the DPd group and 20.1% of subjects in the Pd 
group. There were no Grade 4 haematology values of low hemoglobin in either treatment group.  
All laboratory parameters in Study MMY3013 were reviewed. No laboratory parameters had an incidence of 
Grade  3  or  4  values  ≥10%  except  for  haematology  parameters.  Thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia, 
lymphopenia,  leukopenia,  and  anemia  were  listed  in  a  separate  haematology  laboratory  table  based  on 
haematology laboratory parameters regardless of the incidence and difference between groups (Table 32).  
In Study MMY1001, the most common Grade 3 or 4 haematology laboratory abnormalities were neutrophils 
low (82.4%) and lymphocytes low (72.5%). Grade 3 or 4 platelets low was reported by 19.6% of subjects. 
Grade 3 hemoglobin low was reported for 32.4% of subjects. No Grade 4 hemoglobin low was reported.  
Clinical chemistry 
The incidence of treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 chemistry laboratory abnormalities in Study MMY3013 
was low (<5%) in both treatment groups with the exception of Grade 3 low potassium (DPd: 5.4%; Pd: 
3.4%).

Post marketing experience 
Daratumumab SC has only recently been authorized for use in the US, EU and other countries worldwide. 
Postmarketing  safety  information  is  available  for  daratumumab  IV  and  from  a  commercially  available 
rHuPH20 formulation, Hylenex.  
A cumulative review was performed on all post-marketing spontaneous cases of daratumumab IV and all 
events received by the Global Medical Safety (GMS) global safety database cumulatively through 31 March 
2020. The results suggest that the drug’s post-marketing safety profile is consistent with the known safety 
profile of daratumumab as a single agent or in combination therapy. 
Overall, review of post-marketing spontaneous reports did not identify any new safety signal.  
Assessment report

rHuPH20 is the active ingredient of Halozyme’s commercial product Hylenex recombinant (hyaluronidase 
human injection), hereafter referred to as HYLENEX, which was approved in December 2005 by FDA for 
marketing  in  the  U.S.  HYLENEX  is  a  tissue  permeability  modifier  indicated  as  an  adjuvant  in  SC  fluid 
administration for achieving hydration, to increase the dispersion and absorption of other injected drugs, 
and in SC urography, for improving resorption of radiopaque agents (HYLENEX PI 2016).  
The MAH has provided information about post-marketing experience for SC daratumumab up to 31 January 
2021. There is limited information since SC formulation was approved in the US and EU in May and June 
2020,  respectively.  The  estimated  exposure  to  SC  daratumumab  is  7,413  person-years  and  to  IV 
daratumumab is 112,010 person-years. From the global safety database, 7,257 events have been further 
analysed but including both IV and SC formulations. The most commonly reported PTs for overall AEs and 
AEs with a fatal outcome were generally in line with the widely reported in all daratumumab studies. Frome 
these 7,257 events, 160 reported SC administration of daratumumab but no relevant differences have been 
observed  in  reported  PTs  for  them  and  the  overall  safety  population.  No  new  safety  signals  have  been 
identified  from  this  updated  safety  data  which  seems  to  confirm  the  similar  safety  profile  of  the  SC 
formulation, with the exception of those related to the administration route 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of daratumumab, in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, for patients 
with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received, at least, one prior line of therapy with 
both  lenalidomide  and  a  proteasome  inhibitor  (PI),  is  based  on  the  results  from  the  open-label  Phase  3 
Study  MMY3013,  APOLLO  study.  Supportive  data  from  the  cohort  of  subjects  who  received  the  same 
treatment combination in the Phase 1b Study MMY1001 have been provided. In this previous study, patients 
had received at least 2 prior lines of therapy. 
The  adverse  event  profile  of  daratumumab  with  Pd  was  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profiles  of 
daratumumab and Pd regimens alone. Syncope was added as a new ADR: As an SAE this occurred in 2% 
in the DPd arm and 0 in the Pd arm and overall 6.7% and 0.7%, respectively. Syncope Grade 3 occurred 
in 4% (there were no grade 4).  
The most clinically important adverse events (all grades, preferred terms) more frequently reported in the 
DPd arm compared to the Pd arm in study 3013 were neutropenia (70.5% vs 53.3%), diarrhoea (22.1% 
vs 14.0%), and pneumonia (20.1% vs 12.7%), see Table 24. 
Focusing on maximum toxicity grade, 87.9% of subjects in the DPd group reported any Grade ≥3 TEAE 
while this figure was 82% in the Pd treatment group. Higher differences between both groups were found 
in neutropenia (67.8% DPd vs 50.7% Pd), leukopenia (16.8% vs 4.7%), pneumonia (13.4% vs 6.7%), 
lymphopenia (12.1% vs 3.3%) and febrile neutropenia (8.7% vs 2.7%). As previously observed with 
other daratumumab combinations, differences were mostly driven by haematological AEs. 
The incidence of SAEs was higher in the DPd group (50.3%) compared to the Pd group (39.3%). The most 
common preferred terms were: Pneumonia (DPd: 15.4%, Pd: 8.0%) and Lower respiratory tract infection 
(DPd: 12.1%, Pd: 9.3%).  
Cytopenias  and  infections  are  well-known  AEs  for  both  daratumumab  and  pomalidomide  and  thus,  not 
unexpectedly, occurring more frequently in the DPd arm. 
The number of subjects with any Grade TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was 11 (7.4%) in the 
DPd arm and 5 (3.3%) in the Pd treatment arm. For Grade 3 or 4, this proportion was similar (5.4% DPd 
vs 2.7% Pd) and also higher for the experimental treatment.  
TEAEs with an outcome of death were similar between treatment groups (DPd: 7.4%; Pd: 7.3%).  
The incidence of haemorrhagic events in study 1001 was six times higher than in study 3013. There were 
no fatal haemorrhagic events and no cerebral haemorrhagic events in the DPd arm in any of these studies. 
The patients in study 1001 had a median of 4 prior treatments compared to 2 prior treatments in study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/266131/2021 
Page 70/79 
 
 
 
 
 
3013. The median age was 64 and 67, respectively. Differences in baseline and disease characteristics likely 
contributed  to  the  difference  in  haemorrhagic  events  between  study  MMY3013  and  MMY1001.  The  MAH 
showed that difference in haemorrhagic events observed between studies was primarily driven by Grade 1 
events, which are of low clinical significance. In general, the incidence of TEAEs was lower or consistent in 
Study  MMY3013  compared  to  Study  MMY1001.  Study  MMY1001  represented a  more  heavily  pre-treated 
study  population  with  a  median of  4  prior  lines of  treatment  (compared  to  a median  of  2  prior  lines  for 
Study MMY3013). This could in part explain the higher rates of TEAEs observed in Study MMY1001 despite 
a shorter treatment duration than Study MMY3013. 
Infections are known ADRs for daratumumab, which in study 3013 in combination with Pd clearly increases 
with  age  as  opposed  to  what  is  seen  in  the  Pd  arm  (Table  34).  The  SmPC  includes  a  warning  to  alert 
physicians  to  the  higher  incidence  of  serious  adverse  reactions  in  elderly  patients.  Among  patients  with 
relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, the most common serious adverse reactions that occurred more 
frequently in elderly were pneumonia and sepsis.” This is considered sufficient information to minimise the 
risk in this age group.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Safety is generally unchanged from previous studies.  Deaths due to TEAEs were comparable between the 
two  arms,  but  the  median  age  of  the  study  population  was  67  years  (and  a  median  of  4.4  years  after 
diagnosis),  so  outside  clinical  trials  SAEs  and  deaths  due  to  infections  would  be  expected  to  be  higher. 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  daratumumab  in  this  new  combination  can  be  considered  in  line  with  the 
already known safety profile.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC of the 
subcutaneous formulation are updated.  In addition section 4.8 of the SmPC for the intravenous 
formulation is also updated based on the pooled safety analysis. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. Version 8.5 of the RMP has also been submitted. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing additional user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
•  Full user testing in compliance with the above-mentioned legislative requirements was performed 
(n=20  participants)  on  the  package  leaflet  developed  for  DARZALEX  for  the  initial  Marketing 
Authorisation Application. 
•  An additional user testing (n= 10 participants) was conducted for a bridging report on the package 
leaflet developed for the Line extension Application of the DARZALEX subcutaneous formulation. 
•  The package leaflet included in this current application has the same format as the one previously 
approved.

•  With  the  currently  proposed  indication  extension,  minimal  changes  have  been  introduced  to  the 
package leaflet and the proposed changes reflect language and a format that is consistent with that 
in the currently approved leaflet for the subcutaneous formulation. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The  proposed  addition  to  the  existing  indication  statement  in  section  4.1  of  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) is as follows (proposed text in bold): 
“DARZALEX is indicated in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, or as monotherapy 
for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  relapsed  and  refractory  multiple  myeloma,  whose  prior  therapy 
included  a  proteasome  inhibitor  and  an  immunomodulatory  agent  and  who  have  demonstrated  disease 
progression on the last therapy.” 
The  Applicant  has,  upon  request,  separated  the  indication  for  the  current  application  from  the  previous 
indication  regarding  Darzalex  monotherapy,  replaced  “IMID”  with  “lenalidomide”,  removed  ‘relapsed  or 
refractory’ and clarified the indication after one and two prior therapies. 
“DARZALEX is indicated in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult 
patients  with  multiple  myeloma  who  have  received  one  prior  therapy  containing  a  proteasome 
inhibitor  and  lenalidomide  and  were lenalidomide-refractory,  or  who  have  received  at least two  prior 
therapies  that  included  lenalidomide  and  a  proteasome  inhibitor  and  have  demonstrated  disease 
progression on or after the last therapy (see section 5.1)” 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Multiple  myeloma  is  an  incurable  malignant  plasma  cell  disorder  diagnosed  annually  in  approximately 
160,000 patients worldwide (Bray 2018). The median age at diagnosis is 72 years. 
Multiple myeloma is characterised by osteolytic lesions, usually in the pelvis, spine, ribs, and skull. Lesions 
are  caused  by  expanding  plasmacytomas  or  by  cytokines  secreted  by  myeloma  cells  that  activate 
osteoclasts  and  suppress  osteoblasts.  Increased  bone  loss  may  also  lead  to  hypercalcemia.  Solitary 
extraosseous plasmacytomas are unusual but may occur in any tissue, especially in the upper respiratory 
tract. In many patients, renal failure is present at diagnosis or develops during the course of the disorder 
and is caused by the deposition of light chains in the distal tubules or by hypercalcemia. Patients also often 
develop anemia due to kidney disease or suppression of erythropoiesis by cancer cells, but sometimes also 
due to iron deficiency. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Different classes of drugs are approved for multiple myeloma (alkylators, steroids, proteasome inhibitors 
[PIs],  immunomodulatory  agents  [IMiDs],  histone  deacetylase  inhibitors  [HDACIs]  and  monoclonal 
antibodies).  Among  these  treatment  options,  lenalidomide  (an  IMiD)  and  bortezomib  (a  PI)  have  a 
prominent  role.  Both  are  approved  and  used  as  frontline  treatment  of  multiple  myeloma  and  used  in 
combination with other drugs at relapse. Lenalidomide is also approved as maintenance therapy after ASCT 
in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Patients who have been treated with lenalidomide and 
a  PI  are  a  challenge  to  treat  as  they  have  already  been  exposed  to  2  major drug  classes.  Patients  who 
relapse during ongoing treatment or within 60 days of last dose of lenalidomide are per IMWG definition 
“lenalidomide  refractory”  and  represent  an  additional  challenge  for  choosing  an  effective  subsequent 
treatment choice.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/266131/2021 
Page 73/79 
 
 
 
 
Patients with exposure to lenalidomide and a PI as well as patients refractory to lenalidomide have a high 
unmet medical need, and new effective and convenient treatment options are needed (Moreau 2019). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The purpose of the pivotal phase 3 study MMY3013 was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DPd to Pd in 
subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma having received prior lenalidomide and an IMiD (96% 
had received bortezomib) using the primary endpoint of PFS based on IMWG criteria.  
Daratumumab was given SC (7 patients received IV before amendment 2). Pd dose was given according to 
Imnovid SmPC. Treatment continued until PD or unacceptable toxicity.  
Subjects  were  randomized  1:1  to  DPd  or  Pd.  Randomization  was  stratified  by  number  of  lines  of  prior 
therapy and ISS stage. The study was open-label. An IDMC conducted the interim analysis. The study was 
initiated in June 2017 in centres in 12 European countries. Data cut-off July 2020. In the DPd arm and the 
Pd arm 151 and 153 patients, respectively, made up the ITT population. 
Supportive data where derived from 103 DPd-treated patients in the phase 1b study MMY1001, which was 
an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and dose regimen of 
daratumumab  IV  when  administered  in  combination  with  various  background  treatment  regimens  for 
multiple myeloma in either newly diagnosed patients or those who had received prior therapies, depending 
on the background treatment regimen.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
At  a  median  overall  follow-up  of  16.9  months  (DPd:  17.5  months;  Pd:  16.4  months)  the  addition  of 
daratumumab SC to Pd resulted in a statistically significant improvement in PFS (HR=0.63; 95% CI: 0.47, 
0.85; 2-sided p=0.0018,). The median PFS was 12.4 months for the DPd treatment group (95% CI; 8.3, 
19.3) and 6.9 months for the Pd treatment group (95% CI; 5.5, 9.3), which is considered clinically relevant 
particularly in a population that had received a median of 2 prior treatments that included lenalidomide and 
a PI. The results were generally consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses, and across pre-specified 
subgroups. 
The result for the primary endpoint is supported by the key secondary endpoint ORR (including sCR and CR 
rates) and rate of MRD negativity, that were significantly better in the DPd arm compared to the Pd arm.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The  response  rate  is  better  in  the  DPd  arm,  with  a  higher  rate  of  CR  and  also  with  a  greater  depth  of 
response  (MRD  negativity).  With  this  in  mind  continuing  with  a  long-term  maintenance  treatment  with 
daratumumab can be questioned in this RRMM population, as prolonged exposure to anti-CD38 could result 
in the emergence of long-term resistance or relapses that could potentially not respond to further treatment 
with anti-CD38 targeted therapy. It is acknowledged that even if these are relevant questions they cannot 
be  addressed  at  this  stage  considering  the  design  of  the  MMY3013  study.  Results  from  the  LYNX  study 
(MMY2065), an ongoing, randomized, open-label, 2-arm, multicenter, phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy 
and  safety  of  treatment  with  D-Kd  versus  carfilzomib  and  dexamethasone  (Kd)  alone  in  patients  with 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received 1-2 prior lines of therapy (at least one 
of  which  included  daratumumab  intravenous  [IV]  therapy)  to  evaluate  daratumumab  retreatment,  are 
awaited,  which  will  give  further  data  of  a  potential benefit of  retreatment  with  daratumumab  after  prior 
daratumumab use.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The  adverse  event  profile  of  daratumumab  with  Pd  was  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profiles  of 
daratumumab and Pd regimens alone. 
The most clinically important adverse events (all grades, preferred terms) more frequently reported in the 
DPd arm compared to the Pd arm in study 3013 were neutropenia (70.5% vs 53.3%), diarrhoea (22.1% 
vs 14.0%), and pneumonia (20.1% vs 12.7%). 
The  frequency  of  Grade  3  or  4  TEAEs  was  higher  in  the  DPd  group  compared  with  the  Pd  group  (DPd: 
80.5%; Pd: 74.7.0%). The incidence of serious TEAEs was higher in the DPd group (50.3%) compared to 
the Pd group (39.3%). The most common (≥5%) serious TEAEs reported were pneumonia (15.4% vs 8.0%) 
and lower respiratory tract infection (12.1% vs 9.3%). 
The incidence of SAEs was higher in the DPd group (50.3%) compared to the Pd group (39.3%). The most 
common preferred terms were: Pneumonia (DPd: 15.4%, Pd: 8.0%) and Lower respiratory tract infection 
(DPd: 12.1%, Pd: 9.3%).  
The number of subjects with any Grade TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was 11 (7.4%) in the 
DPd arm and 5 (3.3%) in the Pd treatment arm. For Grade 3 or 4, this proportion was similar (5.4% DPd 
vs 2.7% Pd) and also higher for the experimental treatment. 
Syncope was added as a new ADR: As an SAE this occurred in 2% in the DPd arm and 0 in the Pd arm and 
overall 6.7% and 0.7%, respectively. Syncope Grade 3 occurred in 4% (there were no grade 4). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Median duration of treatment was longer in DPd arm, 11.5 vs 6.6 months for patients treated with Pd. The 
MAH has provided exposure-adjusted incidence (EAIR) rates for both MMY3013 and DPd cohort in study 
MMY1001.  As  expected,  incidences  for  TEAEs  remain  higher  for  the  DPd  arm  but,  when  analysing  the 
respective EAIRs, the imbalances seem less prominent suggesting that longer exposure plays a key role in 
the high AEs rates observed. Still, DPd combination shows higher incidences for some important TEAEs like 
infections and neutropenia.  
Some  imbalances  were  observed  regarding  baseline  ECOG  performance  status.  The  MAH  has  submitted 
upon request a table including TEAEs incidences by baseline ECOG values to rule out any particular trend 
among subjects included (Table 26). The detailed results do not match the hypothesis that higher ECOG 
would  lead  to  higher  AEs  incidence  rates.  Not  in  all  cases  subjects  with  ECOG  1  reported  higher  AEs 
incidences  than  subjects  with  ECOG  0.  Although  most  of  PTs  were  more  commonly  reported in  subjects 
with ECOG 2, the small sample size of this subgroup (DPd: 6 subjects; Pd: 19 subjects) does not allow any 
definitive  conclusion  to  be  drawn.  Overall,  safety  profile  of  this  new  combination  does  not  seem  to  be 
affected by patients’ ECOG PS. 
There is limited information since SC formulation was approved in the US and EU in May and June 2020, 
respectively. The MAH has provided information about post-marketing experience for SC daratumumab up 
to 31 January 2021. From the global safety database, 7,257 events have been further analysed but include 
both IV and SC formulations. The most commonly reported PTs for overall AEs and AEs with a fatal outcome 
were generally in line with the widely reported in all daratumumab studies. From these 7,257 events, 160 
reported SC administration of daratumumab but no relevant differences have been observed in reported 
PTs for them and the overall safety population.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The median PFS was 12.4 months for the DPd treatment group (95% CI; 8.3, 19.3) and 6.9 months for the 
Pd treatment group (95% CI; 5.5, 9.3), which is considered clinically relevant particularly in a population 
that had received a median of 2 prior treatments that included lenalidomide and a PI. Although the number 
of patients with only 1 prior line was limited, the PFS point estimate was comparable to the overall group. 
Furthermore, there is a need for a line of therapy with another MoA in clinical practice for patients that are 
refractory to lenalidomide and have received a PI in first line. 
There is a statistical relationship between the achievement of complete response (CR), MRD negativity and 
PFS or OS (ESMO guidelines; Moreau et al., 2017), and thus the higher CR and MRD-negativity rates in the 
DPd arm are considered clinically important responses. 
Safety  is  generally  unchanged  from  previous  studies.  Cytopenias  and  infections  are  well-known  AEs  for 
both daratumumab and pomalidomide and thus, not unexpectedly, occurring more frequently in the DPd 
arm. Infections are known ADRs  for daratumumab. The rate of infections in study 3013 in the DPd arm 
clearly increases with age as opposed to what is seen in the Pd arm Increasing rate of adverse events with 
age is noted in the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/266131/2021 
Page 76/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is of concern, that infections are common and higher with age. Deaths due to TEAEs were comparable 
between the two arms, but the median age of the study population was 67 years (and a median of 4.4 
years after diagnosis), so outside clinical trials SAEs and deaths due to infections could be expected to be 
higher considering that the median age at diagnosis for multiple myeloma patients is 72 years in Europe. 
However,  these  risks  to  a  large  extent  can  be  managed  with  the  warnings  included  in  the  product 
information.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The improvement in PFS is considered clinically relevant. Well-known adverse events such as infection and 
neutropenia are frequent as well as a higher incidence of these AEs with increasing age. The benefits to 
patients from the prolongation of PFS by DPd treatment therefore outweighs the risks associated with its 
use.   
The  MAH  has  revised  the  wording  of  the  indication  to  better  reflect  the  target  population  and  has  also 
accepted  to  include  it  separately  from  the  one  covering  the  use  of  daratumumab  in  monotherapy. 
Furthermore, “IMID” has been replaced with “lenalidomide” and ‘relapsed or refractory’ has been removed.  
The following wording has been agreed: 
“DARZALEX is indicated in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult 
patients with multiple myeloma who have received one prior therapy containing a proteasome inhibitor 
and lenalidomide and were lenalidomide-refractory, or who have received at least two prior therapies that 
included lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on or after 
the last therapy (see section 5.1).” 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Darzalex is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. In addition, section 4.8 of the SmPC for the 
intravenous formulation is also updated based on the pooled safety analysis. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. Version 8.2 of the RMP has also been submitted. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Darzalex is not similar to Imnovid, Farydak, Kyprolis, 
Ninlaro  and Blenrep within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See 
appendix 1 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial 
marketing authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal 
product. In particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the 
assessment report of the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to 
the authorisation, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential 
information, please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of 
commercially confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification by 
<No date in SIAMED>. The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the EMA 
website at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/heads-medicines-agencies/european-
medicines-agency-guidance-document-identification-commercially-confidential-information_en.pdf 
In addition, should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains personal data, please 
provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of these data in “track changes” and 
with detailed justification by <No date in SIAMED>. We would like to remind you that, according to 
Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, “GDPR”) ‘personal 
data’ means any information, relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (the ‘data 
subject’). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in 
particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an 
online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, 
economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. 
It is important to clarify that pseudonymised data are also considered personal data. According to 
Article 4(5) of GDPR pseudonymisation means that personal data is processed in a manner that the 
personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional 
information (e.g. key-coded data).  
Accordingly, the name and the patient identification number are two examples of personal data 
which may relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. The definitions also encompass for 
instance: office e-mail address or phone number of a company, data concerning health, e.g. 
information in medical records, clinical reports or case narratives which relates to an identifiable 
individual.” 
2. 
The MAH is reminded to submit an eCTD closing sequence with the final documents provided by 
Eudralink during the procedure (including final PI translations, if applicable) within 15 days after the 
Commission Decision, if there will be one within 2 months from adoption of the CHMP Opinion, or 
prior to the next regulatory activity, whichever is first. If the Commission Decision will be adopted 
within 12 months from CHMP Opinion, the closing sequence should be submitted within 30 days 
after the Opinion. For additional guidance see chapter 4.1 of the Harmonised Technical Guidance for 
eCTD Submissions in the EU. 
3. 
If the approved RMP is using Rev. 2 of the ‘Guidance on the format of the RMP in the EU’ and the 
RMP ‘Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan’ has been updated in the procedure, the MAH 
is reminded to provide to the EMA Procedure Assistant by Eudralink a PDF version of the ‘Part VI: 
Summary of the risk management plan’ as a standalone document, within 14 calendar days of the 
receipt of the CHMP Opinion. The PDF should contain only text and tables and be free of metadata, 
headers and footers.

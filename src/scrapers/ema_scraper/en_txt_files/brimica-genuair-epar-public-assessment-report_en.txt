1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Almirall S.A submitted on 5 February 2014 an application for Marketing Authorisation to the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Brimica Genuair, through the centralised procedure under Article 3 
(2) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by 
the EMA/CHMP on 21 March 2013. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: “Brimica Genuair is indicated as a maintenance 
bronchodilator treatment for airflow obstruction and relief of symptoms in adult patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).” 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 10(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC – relating to applications for fixed combination medicinal product. 
This application is submitted as a multiple of Duaklir Genuair simultaneously being under initial 
assessment in accordance with Article 82.1 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
C/W/2011 on the granting of a class waiver.  
The proposed indication is for the symptomatic treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 
(COPD). This indication is not applicable for the paediatric population. Therefore no studies have been 
conducted in the paediatric population. 
On 30 April 2009, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) confirmed the applicability to 
aclidinium/formoterol of the EMA decision (P/1/2007) of 3 December 2007 on a class waiver from the 
European Paediatric Regulation (Regulation [EC] Number 1901/2006) granted for the condition COPD. 
Aclidinium/formoterol is indicated for adult patients only.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific Advice 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 20 May 2010, 4 October 2010 and 23 June 
2011.The Scientific Advice pertained to quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier. At this time,

advice with regard the proposed overall clinical programme (including the clinical pharmacology and 
Phase III programmes) and safety database. CHMP clarifications on aspects of the advice received on the 
clinical pharmacology programme were given in October 2010. 
Once the results from the Phase II dose-finding studies of aclidinium/formoterol (LAC-MD-27, 
M/40464/26) and from the Phase III studies of aclidinium monotherapy were available, the Applicant 
revised the proposed clinical development programme in accordance with the CHMP Scientific Advice 
received in 2010. Follow-up Scientific Advice was provided by the CHMP in June 2011 regarding the 
dose-selection for the Phase III studies of aclidinium/formoterol, the revised Phase III clinical programme 
and the clinical data required to support the bridge between the registered formoterol monotherapy 
(Foradil® Aerolizer®) and formoterol monotherapy via Genuair®.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
COPD is a preventable respiratory disorder characterised by airflow limitation, which is not fully 
reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory 
response in the lungs to noxious particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. COPD is 
characterized by symptoms of chronic and progressive breathlessness (or dyspnea), cough, and sputum 
production which can be a major cause of disability and anxiety associated with the disease. 
The disease is not limited to the airways and treating physicians are faced with a multi-component disease 
that is characterised by a range of pathological changes, which include mucous hypersecretion, airway 
narrowing, loss of alveoli in the lungs, and loss of lean body mass and cardiovascular effects at a systemic 
level. COPD patients are also heterogeneous in terms of their clinical presentation, disease severity and 
rate of disease progression. Their degree of airflow limitation, as measured by FEV1, is also known to be 
poorly correlated to the severity of their symptoms. 
COPD is a major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality throughout the world. It is estimated that 
approximately eight percent of the population have COPD and approximately ten percent of those over 40 
years of age. However the true prevalence of the disease is likely to be higher than this due to 
under-diagnosis and delayed diagnosis until the disease becomes clinically apparent and is then 
moderately advanced. COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in Europe and is expected to rise to third 
by 2020. 
The goals of COPD assessment are to determine the severity of the disease, its impact on patient’s health 
status and the risk of future events (such as exacerbations, hospital admissions or death), in order to, 
eventually guide therapy. The most used classification based on severity of airflow limitation in COPD 
(based on post-bronchodilatory FEV1) is the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 
(GOLD) classification. Patients with FEV1/FVC <0.70 are classified into mild, moderate, severe and very 
severe based on spirometry as below: 
GOLD 1  Mild 
FEV1 ≥ 80% predicted 
GOLD 2  Moderate 
50% ≤ FEV1 < 80% predicted 
GOLD 3  Severe 
30% ≤ FEV1 < 50% predicted 
GOLD 4  Very Severe  FEV1 < 30% predicted 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 10/136 
 
 
 
 
 
Recently, GOLD has recommended an approach of combined COPD assessment based on the impact of 
COPD on an individual patient which combines symptomatic assessment with the patient’s spirometric 
classification and/or risk of exacerbations. This approach is illustrated below.  
The most important aspect of management of the condition is educational and social: the avoidance and 
cessation of tobacco smoking. However, once COPD is established the recommendations for the 
pharmacological treatment of COPD are based on the severity of the condition. The current GOLD 
recommendations on the pharmacological therapy for stable COPD are depicted below:

The GOLD recommendation is that the combined use of long-acting beta agonists and anticholinergics 
may be considered if symptoms are not improved with single agents (Evidence  - B which is randomized 
controlled trials – limited body of data).

Aclidinium bromide is a non-hygroscopic white or off-white crystalline powder sparingly soluble in 
methanol, very slightly soluble in water and in ethanol, and practically insoluble in acetone, ethyl acetate, 
tetrahydrofuran and toluene.  
Aclidinium bromide exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 1 chiral centre. Aclidinium bromide 
was shown to exist in a single crystalline form (Form I).. The information on the active substance is 
provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) procedure. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, aclidinium bromide information was assessed in Eklira and Bretaris 
Genuair which were granted a marketing authorisation in the EU in July 2012.  
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, melting point (Ph Eur), identification (IR, 
Bromides), loss on drying (Ph Eur), sulphated ash (Ph Eur), heavy metals, assay (HPLC), organic 
impurities (HPLC), residual organic solvents (Ph Eur), particle size distribution (laser diffraction).  
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data (3 validation batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 3 production batches of active substance from the manufacturer stored in the intended 
commercial package for 60 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and 30 ºC / 65% RH 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed. Forced degradation 
studies exposing the active substance to acid, base, aqueous, oxidative and high intensity light conditions 
have also been performed demonstrating that the active substance is sensitive to basic, acidic and 
oxidative conditions . Supporting data was provided to support the proposed requirements for storage 
and labelling and to demonstrate that standard handling and storage procedures for micronized 
aclidinium bromide are sufficient to ensure that the quality and the consistency of the active substance 
are maintained. This includes a risk assessment of the various handling and storage considerations. 
The analytical methods and parameters used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.

Formoterol  
Formoterol fumarate dihydrate is an established active substance described in Ph Eur. 
The chemical name of formeterol is 
(±)-N-[2-hydroxy-5-[(1RS)-1-hydroxy-2-[[(1RS)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]amino]ethyl]ph
enyl] formamide, (E)-2-butenedioate (2:1 salt) dihydrate and has the following structure: 
As there is a monograph of formoterol in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active 
substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for 
formoterol fumarate dihydrate which was provided within the current Marketing Authorisation 
Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Specification 
The control tests were carried out to comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. 
monograph. In addition to the compendial tests the active substance manufacturer routinely controls 
identification of crystal form and degree of crystallinity, residue on ignition, heavy metals, palladium, 
residual solvents, particle size distribution and microbiological purity. The finished product manufacturer 
carries out additional tests for palladium, residual solvents and particle size distribution. All additional 
methods were adequately validated and described according to ICH Q2.  
Stability 
The relevant information was assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
In addition to the stability testing being carried out by the active substance manufacturer, supportive 
stability studies to control some specific parameters were carried out during the development program. 
These specific parameters include those considered as potentially critical for a drug substance to be used 
in an inhalation product.  
Supportive stability studies were performed on the same three micronized batches used as primary ICH 
stability batches and was completed with 36 months data at 25ºC/60%RH, 12 months data at 
30ºC/65%RH and 6 month data at 40ºC/75%RH.

The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Aclidinium bromide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate was formulated as a combination in the finished 
medicinal product of the active substances and lactose monohydrate as sole excipient in the device 
metered Genuair dry powder inhaler as the primary packaging. 
A fixed combination of aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate inhalation powder was 
developed based on the development of the aclidinium monotherapy inhalation powder. 
The development of the product was satisfactorily performed and explained and is in accordance with EU 
guidelines on Development pharmaceutics and EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr. on the 
Pharmaceutical Quality of Inhalation and Nasal Products. Particle size requirements for both API´s and 
lactose monohydrate have been justified in terms of their contributions to finished product performance 
characteristics. Device cleaning issues have been properly addressed and the valid cleaning procedures 
are reflected in the proposed patient leaflet. 
The packaging materials have shown suitability by acceptable product performance characteristics and 
stability studies. 
Inclusion of a lock-out mechanism and overfill in the inhaler means that there is no tail-off in the 
performance up to the labelled number of actuations when the lock-out of the device occurs beyond the 
labelled number of actuations. Several studies, including “in-use” studies, investigating delivered dose 
and fine particle dose of the inhalation powder confirmed the consistent pharmaceutical performance 
beyond actuation 60.  
The inhalation powder is presented in a device-metered dry powder inhaler as the primary packaging, 
which contains not less than 60 actuations per cartridge. This is overwrapped and heat-sealed in an 
aluminium pouch with a desiccant sachet. The inhalation powder is permanently situated in a 
device-metered dry powder inhaler with an integral dose indicator and a removable protective cap. The 
inhaler is sealed in an aluminium pouch. The material in contact with the inhaler is manufactured in 
accordance with the EU requirements for direct contact with food and drugs (EU Regulation No. 10/2011, 
as amended). All tests and specifications together with certificates of analysis from the approved supplier 
and the finished product manufacturer were provided and all results met specification. 
The desiccant sachet also complies with current EU requirements. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 3 main steps: blending and sieving, dosing and assembly, labelling 
and packaging.  
The manufacturing formula, flow chart and description of the manufacturing process were provided. 
Critical steps are identified and there are no intermediates isolated during the manufacturing process.

Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.   
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description, active substance identification (HPLC-UV and Diode Array Detection (DAD), physicochemical 
properties (filling, number of actuations per inhaler), purity by Rapid Resolution Liquid Chromatography 
(RRLC), water content, assay (HPLC), particle size (HPLC) and microbiological control. 
Batch analysis data on 3 production scale batch and several supportive batches (development, clinical 
and stability batches) has been provided. Data batches confirm consistency and uniformity of the product 
indicating that the process is under control. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 production scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 36 
months at 25 ºC / 60% RH, intermediate storage conditions of 30°C/75% RH and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The batches of the medicinal product are to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing. 
In addition, in-use stability over 90 days was confirmed for a freshly produced batch, as well as for an 
aged batch. Supporting in-use stability studies was also performed on development batches. Stability 
studies have been performed in accordance with ICH Q1A and Q1B. 
In addition ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products was performed. 
Samples were tested for: appearance, physicochemical properties, identification of the active substance, 
assay, purity, water content and microbial control. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical studies conducted in support of this application are limited to three non-GLP 
cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies, a preliminary maximum tolerated dose inhalation study and 
two GLP inhalation toxicity bridging studies of 4 and 13 weeks duration. The data submitted were 
assessed with respect to the legal basis of the application, applicable guidelines and other scientific 
criteria. Limited new non-clinical studies have been submitted. The pivotal repeated-dose inhalation 
toxicity studies were conducted in accordance with GLP. However, three cardiovascular safety 
pharmacology studies were not conducted according to GLP. The Applicant argues that the data quality 
and integrity were to good scientific standards and in line with the Guideline on Safety pharmacology 
studies for human pharmaceuticals (ICH S7A). This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies and Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The pharmacological profiles of both aclidinium and formoterol have been extensively characterised and 
it is accepted that their bronchodilator activity is achieved by different mechanisms of action. Aclidinium 
is a cholinergic antagonist with a strong and selective affinity for the human M3 muscarinic receptor, 
whereas formoterol is a long-acting selective β2-adrenergic receptor agonist. 
No additional primary or secondary pharmacology studies have been conducted using the combination 
which is in line with ICH and EU guidance on developing a fixed dose combination product containing two 
approved compounds. The lack of primary and secondary pharmacology studies is accepted by the CHMP. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacology studies apart from cardiovascular safety studies were performed with the 
combination of aclidinium and formoterol since each individual component has been extensively 
investigated in various studies on CNS, respiratory, renal/urinary and gastrointestinal safety models, and 
pharmacological interactions are not expected from the combination of these two agents given their 
different modes of action. 
Two non-GLP cardiovascular safety studies have been conducted in dogs using the i.v. route to further

investigate the ventricular tachycardia finding in the 4-week toxicity bridging study in dogs using the 
combination via the inhalation route (RCC A25301). The dog was selected for safety evaluation of both 
aclidinium and formoterol as it is considered a suitable model for the detection of cardiovascular effects. 
A third study was performed to assess the effects on heart rate of aclidinium administered concomitantly 
with formoterol or salmeterol, and tiotropium administered concomitantly with the same β2-adrenergic 
agonists (FD0601JG). 
Study FD0603MV 
The cardiovascular safety and of the combination of aclidinium and formoterol in a 17:1 ratio have been 
evaluated in conscious beagle dogs by i.v. administration (Table 2.4-2). 
Formoterol dose-dependently induced ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the study. Formoterol 1 μg/kg did 
not induce VT. In contrast, VT appeared in one and four out of the four formoterol-treated dogs at the 
doses of 3 and 10 μg/kg respectively. When the combination of aclidinium and formoterol was 
administered at the lowest dose (17+1 μg/kg), no VT was observed. However, VT appeared in two 
animals at the dose of 50+3 μg/kg of the combination of aclidinium and formoterol, and in three out of 
four animals, at the highest dose (167+10 μg/kg). 
Study BIOL0835 
A second cardiovascular safety study was performed in dogs to assess the effects of the combination of 
formoterol and aclidinium on VT at the 33:1 ratio used in the aclidinium/formoterol intended therapeutic 
dose (400/12 μg BID) for the treatment of patients with COPD.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 19/136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Formoterol 3 μg/kg caused ventricular tachycardia in one out of four dogs, consistent with the formoterol 
results reported previously. Concerning the effects of the combination of aclidinium and formoterol at the 
dose of 33+1 μg/kg, no animals showed arrhythmias. At the dose of 100+3 μg/kg, VT was observed in 
four out of four animals. However, the incidence on VT was less than 1% of cardiac beats in the 90-minute 
observation period in two dogs. Therefore, the effects on VT are not considered different between 
formoterol at 3 mg/kg dose and aclidinium/formoterol combination at 100+3 mg/kg dose in this study. 
The dose of 100+3 μg/kg produced very high systemic exposure in the test animals compared to human 
dose based on Cmax (1,471 times for aclidinium and 297 times for formoterol). 
The dose of the combination that did not result in VT in this study (33+1 μg/kg) produced a systemic 
exposure that is 286 times higher for aclidinium and 71 times higher for formoterol based on Cmax, 
compared with the systemic exposure at the MRDD of aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg BID for the 
treatment of patients with COPD (Cmax: 0.128 ng/mL for aclidinium, and 0.0167 ng/mL for formoterol; 
LAC-PK-01). 
Study FD0601JG 
In addition, a third study was performed to assess the effects on heart rate of aclidinium administered 
concomitantly with formoterol or salmeterol, and tiotropium administered concomitantly with the same 
β2-adrenergic agonists. 
In this study, aclidinium 10 μg/kg administered intravenously in combination with formoterol 0.3 μg/kg 
produced a numerically smaller increase in heart rate than tiotropium 10 μg/kg administered in 
combination with formoterol 0.3 μg/kg or salmeterol 3 μg/kg; however, the changes were not statistically 
significantly different from those observed for tiotropium 10 μg/kg in combination with the same 
β2-adrenergic agonists. The duration of the chronotropic effect measured as time to decrease the effect 
by 50% (t½) was statistically significantly shorter for aclidinium plus formoterol or salmeterol compared 
with tiotropium plus formoterol or salmeterol. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted. Based on the well-established, 
distinct mechanisms of action for both active substances no drug-interactions are expected. The 
arguments for not performing pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were regarded as acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of aclidinium and formoterol monotherapies have been adequately characterised in 
animals together with their enzyme induction and inhibition profiles.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014

The pharmacokinetic properties of aclidinium after inhalation include: absorption from the lung; a low oral 
bioavailability of the swallowed fraction of the administered dose; tissue distribution (mainly in the 
bladder, pancreas, kidneys and tissues of the gastrointestinal tract) and, as a principal characteristic, 
rapid and complete clearance from the body as a consequence of its non-enzymatic (chemical) and 
enzymatic ester hydrolysis. 
The major metabolite circulating in plasma is the acid derivative, LAS34850 (human plasma half-life 9.4 
h), whereas the plasma levels of the alcohol metabolite, LAS34823, are normally similar to those for the 
unchanged drug. Both metabolites are devoid of pharmacological activity. Because of the low plasma 
levels achieved at clinically relevant doses, aclidinium and its two metabolites are not expected to alter 
the disposition of medicinal products metabolised by the human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and 
esterase activities. 
Formoterol is rapidly absorbed into plasma after inhalation, reaching a maximum plasma concentration 
within 5 minutes after dosing. A fraction of inhaled formoterol is deposited in the mouth and is most likely 
absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. The most prominent metabolic pathway involves direct conjugation 
at the phenolic hydroxyl group. Secondary metabolic pathways include deformylation and sulfate 
conjugation. CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2A6 have been identified as being primarily responsible 
for O-demethylation. 
As the pharmacokinetic profiles of both active substances have previously been characterised, no 
additional studies with individual active substances are required. In addition, given the different 
metabolic profiles and apparent lack of interaction from TK and clinical exposure data, no further 
pharmacokinetic studies with the combination are considered necessary by the CHMP. 
Methods of analysis 
Aclidinium and its metabolites LAS34823 and LAS34850 
Aclidinium bromide, a quaternary ammonium ester salt, in plasma in vivo is rapidly hydrolysed to its 
alcohol (LAS34823) and carboxylic acid (LAS34850) metabolites. A liquid chromatography–tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) bioanalytical method was developed using PMSF to stabilise the preclinical 
samples. The assay was validated under strictly controlled conditions of time and temperature during the 
freeze/thaw process of samples and was successfully validated without stability issues. The approach of 
stabilization of the blood samples with esterase inhibitor immediately upon blood collection was 
successfully applied to analysis of dog plasma samples with concentration ranges of 0.1-30 ng/mL for 
aclidinium bromide and LAS34823, and 5-200 ng/mL for LAS34850. 
Formoterol 
Two LC-MS/MS bioanalytical methods were developed for the determination of formoterol in dog plasma. 
1) Method used in MTD (B.273FO.A) and 4-week inhalation study in dogs (B.273FO.02). 
The determination of formoterol in dog plasma (0.1 mL) was carried out by LC/MS/MS (positive 
ionisation) using MRM ion detection. The analyte was extracted from plasma by an automated protein 
precipitation extraction procedure using the compound LAS39017 as internal standard. The ionization of 
the analyte was performed in a TurboIonSpray source, which makes use of a heated auxiliary gas flow. 
The results obtained in terms of selectivity, linearity, quantitation limit, intra- and inter-batch precision 
and accuracy, recovery, stability, dilution effect and matrix effect demonstrated the suitability of this 
method for the quantitative measurements of formoterol in dog plasma (0.1 mL) within the validated 
concentration range of 0.1-10 ng/mL. 
2) Method used in the 13-week inhalation toxicity study in dogs (B.273FO.04). 
Assessment report

A new bioanalytical method was developed and validated for the determination of formoterol in dog 
plasma (0.1 mL) within the concentration range of 10-2000 pg/mL. The determination of formoterol was 
carried out by LC/MS/MS (positive ionisation) using MRM ion detection. The analyte was extracted from 
plasma by an automated protein precipitation extraction procedure using deuterated formoterol 
(formoterol-D6) as internal standard. The ionisation of the analyte was performed in a TurboIonSpray 
source, which makes use of a heated auxiliary gas flow. The results obtained in terms of selectivity, 
linearity, quantification limit, intra- and inter-batch precision and accuracy, recovery, stability, dilution 
effect and matrix effect demonstrated the suitability of this validated concentration range of 10-2000 
pg/mL. Appropriate, validated methods of analysis have been used to detect and quantify both active 
substances in samples taken in the combination toxicity studies. 
Absorption  
The absorption of aclidinium and formoterol has been assessed in the toxicokinetics conducted during the 
4-week and 13-week inhalation toxicity studies in dogs.  
In the 13-week inhalation toxicity study in dogs (B.273FO.04), the main aclidinium metabolite circulating 
in plasma was the acid derivative, LAS34850, achieving AUC0-24 values up to 98-fold higher than those of 
the unchanged compound. By contrast, the plasma levels of the alcohol metabolite, LAS34823, were 
somewhat similar or slightly higher than those of aclidinium. This pharmacokinetic behaviour is in 
agreement with the results found in the previous 4-week inhalation toxicity study of aclidinium/formoterol 
in dogs (B.273FO.02). 
There was a trend of increasing exposure parameters of aclidinium and formoterol in relation to the 
administered dose. Nevertheless, since the plasma levels were subject to a high degree of variability no 
clear Cmax/dose or AUC/dose relationships were observed. The comparison between sexes for both 
aclidinium and formoterol administered alone or in combination showed also a high degree of variability 
with no significant differences. The comparison between days of treatment for aclidinium showed variable 
results with no clear differences, whereas for formoterol the exposure found in Week 13 (Cmax and 
AUC0-24) was in general lower than that found on Day 1 of treatment, which is consistent with the results 
obtained in the previous 4-week inhalation toxicity study in dogs (B.273FO.02). 
The plasma levels measured after administration of aclidinium 300 μg/kg/day or formoterol 18 μg/kg/day 
administered alone were higher than those obtained when the active substances were administered in 
combination (aclidinium/formoterol 300/18 μg/kg/day). This tendency was more clearly observed for 
formoterol than for aclidinium. However, the mean estimated achieved dose of aclidinium after 
administration of the combination was about 10-20% below the target dose for aclidinium in the 
combination, due to a slight increase in the proportion of formoterol (which was targeted in the 
calculations) in the blend during aerosol generation. On the other hand, there was a higher variability (CV 
up to 50%) in the plasma levels of formoterol in the animals treated with formoterol alone. 
Distribution 
No distribution studies have been conducted with aclidinium/formoterol since both individual active 
substances have been comprehensively investigated. 
Metabolism 
No metabolism studies have been conducted with aclidinium/formoterol since both individual active 
substances have been comprehensively investigated and have shown different metabolic pathways.

Excretion 
No excretion studies have been conducted with aclidinium/formoterol since both active substances have 
been comprehensively investigated. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with aclidinium/formoterol 
since the toxicokinetic studies and clinical assays (M/273FO/22, LAC-PK-01 and M/40464/02) have 
shown that there was no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between both active substances and they have 
different metabolic pathways. The potential drug-drug interactions of aclidinium and formoterol 
monotherapies have been extensively investigated. The CHMP agreed that no further pharmacokinetic 
drug interaction studies are required. 
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
For nonclinical safety assessment of aclidinium/formoterol, a preliminary maximum tolerated dose 
inhalation study, and GLP 4-week and 13-week inhalation toxicity bridging studies were conducted in 
beagle dogs.  
The dog was selected for safety assessment of both aclidinium and formoterol, because the heart is the 
primary toxicity target organ for both drug substances and the dog is a suitable model for the detection 
of cardiovascular effects. 
Formoterol is the more pharmacologically active and potentially toxic component in the 
aclidinium/formoterol combination. Therefore, the dosages of aclidinium/formoterol used in nonclinical 
studies were determined by the formoterol component. 
Single dose toxicity 
No formal single-dose toxicity studies have been conducted with aclidinium/formoterol since both 
individual active substances have been comprehensively investigated. The argument for not performing 
single-dose toxicity studies was regarded as acceptable by the CHMP. However, single inhalation doses up 
to 800/48 μg/kg of aclidinium/formoterol (ratio 17:1) were administered to dogs in the maximum 
tolerated dose study.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Maximum Tolerated Dose Study (RCC A25290) 
A 10% blend of aclidinium/formoterol (ratio 200:12 [17:1]) in lactose was administered by inhalation to 
beagle dogs. During the first phase of the study, the animals (1M+1F) from Group 1 were exposed to 
single target doses of 100/6, 300/18, 400/24, 500/30, 600/36, 700/42, and 800/48 μg/kg of 
aclidinium/formoterol for 13 days including 8 treatment days. During the second phase of the study, the 
animals (2M+2F) from Group 2 were given aclidinium/formoterol 800/48 μg/kg/day for 7 consecutive 
days. 
Tremor, excessive licking, reddening of the conjunctiva, and restlessness were common observations 
noted in both phases of the study. Low food intake and weight loss were also noted in both phases. 
Tachycardia associated with an increase in the P-wave amplitude and decreases in the PQ and QT 
intervals were observed for all animals in this study. The tachycardia was due to the pharmacologic action 
of formoterol, a β-agonist, and was not associated with any gross arrhythmias in the ECG.

There were no macroscopic findings that were considered to be related to treatment with 
aclidinium/formoterol. Based on the results from this study, a dosage of 800/48 μg/kg per day for 7 days 
was considered to be in excess of the maximum tolerated dose. A dosage of 500/30 μg/kg/day was 
considered appropriate for use in the 4-week toxicity study in this species. 
GLP 4-Week Inhalation Toxicity Study (RCC A25301) 
A 10% blend of aclidinium/formoterol (ratio 200:12 ratio [17:1]) in lactose was administered to beagle 
dogs (3M + 3F) by the inhalation route for 4 weeks. Two additional dogs of each sex in Groups 1 and 4 
were  kept  for  a  2-week  treatment-free  recovery  period  following  the  treatment  period  to  assess  the 
reversibility of test item–related effects.  
In the animals receiving 500/30 μg/kg/day, minimal to slight myocardial fibrosis in the papillary muscle 
of the heart occurred in three dogs; ventricular arrhythmias occurred in seven out of ten dogs on Day 2 
of  study.  No  cardiac  lesions  were  observed  at  100/6  μg/kg/day.  However,  at  this  dosage,  ventricular 
arrhythmias were observed in two out of six dogs on Day 2 at predose however not at 2 h or 24 h after 
dosing on Day 2. This cardiac effect is considered to be related to formoterol. 
The  only  effects  of  note  at  the  dosage  of  100/6  μg/kg  per  day  were  severe  ventricular  arrhythmias. 
However, the dog is particularly sensitive to this effect of β-agonists and in the absence of morphologic 
changes in the heart it may be considered unlikely to be significant in man at therapeutic dosages. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014

The dosage of 100/6 μg/kg/day of aclidinium/formoterol was considered the NOAEL, which produced 11 
and 7 times the aclidinium exposure and 18 and 5 times the formoterol exposure, based on Cmax and 
AUC respectively, at the maximum recommended daily dose of aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg BID for 
the treatment of patients with COPD.  
In the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study, cardiac effects were noted at ≥ 33/2 mg aclidinium/fomoterol 
which were attributed to the formoterol component of the combination. Unfortunately the monotherapies 
were  not  included  as  separate  arms  in  the  study,  thus  limiting  the  conclusions  that  can  be  drawn. 
However,  the  individual  active  substances  were  included  in  the  13-week  toxicity  study  allowing  full 
assessment of any additive or synergistic toxic effects. 
In the toxicokinetic study, unexpected concentrations of aclidinium were found on Day 1 and Week 4 in 
some plasma samples from control group animals. The Applicant argues that this contamination probably 
occurred ex  vivo after blood collection, since  no plasma levels of the main metabolite were found. In 
inhalation studies, it is reasonably common for actives to be detected in the plasma of a small number of 
control animals. Taking into account the rapid hydrolysis of aclidinium, the presence of aclidinium but no 
metabolites in the plasma at 24 hours post dosing on week 1 and 4 the Applicant’s explanation seems 
feasible. 
Exposures  following  administration  of  the  low  dose  in  the  4-week  study  were  comparable  with  those 
obtained in the 13-week study and therefore the impact of this contamination on exposure parameters 
and  conclusions  drawn  for  aclidinium  is  deemed  to  be  minimal  by  the  Applicant.  However,  since  it  is 
possible that the AUC(0-24) values are an overestimation, as a precaution only the AUC(0-4) values have 
been used to calculate safety margins.

Aclidinium/formoterol (ratio 200:12 [17:1]) was administered at target dosages of 0/0 (lactose), 33/2, 
100/6, 300/18, 300/0, or 0/18 μg/kg/day to beagle dogs for 13 weeks. Two additional dogs of each sex 
in Groups 1, 4, 5 and 6 were kept for a 4-week treatment-free recovery period following the treatment 
period to assess the reversibility of test item-related effects. 
In the 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study, cardiac effects were observed in all groups that received the 
combination or either active alone. An increase in mean blood creatinine levels was observed in all groups 
treated with formoterol. 
Transient tachycardia occurred in all groups receiving aclidinium/formoterol, and aclidinium or 
formoterol. In addition, an increase in mean blood creatinine levels was observed in groups treated with 
formoterol. 
The increased heart rate was considered to reflect an exaggerated pharmacological response to the 
administration of the β2-agonist (formoterol) and, to a lesser extent, to the administration of the M3 
muscarinic antagonist (aclidinium). The ventricular arrhythmias observed 24 hours after the first dosing 
at 300/18 μg/kg/day were considered to be related to this effect. Ventricular arrhythmias only occurred 
in two out of twelve dogs on the first day following administration of aclidinium/formoterol at the high 
dosage. The decrease in magnitude and incidence of these changes after the first day of dosing indicates 
some accommodation. There were no effects on the ECG at the end of the recovery period. There were no 
morphologic changes in the heart at microscopic examination. 
The increased creatinine levels were probably also related to the increased muscular activity in the heart, 
particularly caused by formoterol, since no increase in creatinine levels was observed in the group treated 
with aclidinium alone. This was still apparent at the end of the recovery period. 
Following microscopic evaluation, no morphological changes to the heart were seen for any of the 
treatment groups. It is noted that amendments to the study report were made to allow microscopic 
re-examination of the sections of the heart for signs of potential injury followed by repair, however no 
evidence of these effects was seen. 
In the absence of any morphologic findings in the heart or significant arrhythmias at dosages of 33/2 or 
100/6 μg/kg/day, the increase in heart rate was considered not to result in any adverse effect at these 
dosage levels. The dosage of 100/6 μg/kg/day of aclidinium/formoterol was considered the NOAEL, which 
produced 14 and 9 times the aclidinium exposure and 20 and 8 times the formoterol exposure based on 
Cmax and AUC respectively, at the maximum recommended daily dose of aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 
μg BID for the treatment of patients with COPD.  
On day 1, ventricular arrhythmias were seen in 2 out of 12 dogs in the high dose group. Persistent 
multifocal ventricular tachycardia or intermittent ventricular tachycardia with ventricular premature 
complexes (VPC) were observed 24 hours after the first day of dosing at 300/18 μg/kg/day 
LAS34273/formoterol in two animals. VPCs also occurred before dosing on Day 7 in one of these animals. 
One further animal of this group also had occasional ventricular premature complexes 24 hours after 
dosing on Day 5. There were no further incidences of similar arrhythmias in the subsequent traces for 
these animals. Based on this finding the NOAEL was considered to be100/6 μg/kg/day of 
aclidinium/formoterol which is associated with safety margins of 14 and 9 times the aclidinium exposure 
and 20 and 8 times the formoterol exposure based on Cmax and AUC respectively, at the maximum 
recommended daily dose of aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg BID for the treatment of patients with 
COPD. 
As no ventricular arrhythmias were seen in the formoterol only group, the possibility that this effect is 
related to administration of the combination cannot be ruled out however based on available exposure

data there is an adequate margin of safety between the dose at which these effects could occur and those 
that can be achieved clinically. 
Genotoxicity 
No new impurities have been identified for the combination medicinal product in addition to those known 
for the individual active substances.  
Aclidinium/formoterol 
The specified impurities and their specification limits in aclidinium/formoterol are the same as for the 
currently marketed aclidinium and formoterol medicinal products and the maximum recommended daily 
dosein patients with COPD is the same for both active substances in the combination (400/12 μg BID) or 
as monotherapies. There were no new impurities identified for the combination drug product. There were 
no new aclidinium-related impurities compared to those previously discussed and qualified, and no new 
formoterol-related impurities compared to those mentioned in the Ph. Eur. monographs.  
Aclidinium bromide 
Five impurities (D, E, H, I, J) found in the drug substance at extremely low concentrations yielded 
structural alerts for genotoxicity using DEREK (deductive estimation of risk from existing knowledge) 
software  and were tested in bacterial reverse mutation assays. Three of these were negative in the 
bacterial reverse mutation assays and are limited in the drug substance specification at ≤0.10% (either 
named or within ‘any unspecified impurity’). Two were positive in reverse mutation assays, one of which, 
1-bromo-3-phenoxy-propane (J) is limited to ≤200 ppm and the other, bromopropoxypropyl derivative 
(E), is limited to ≤0.10%, although exposure to these impurities would be below the standard TTC 
(threshold of toxicological concern) if they were present at their specification limits.  
The active substance specification limits a number of impurities, four of which exceed the relevant ICH 
Q3A (R2) qualification threshold (≥0.15%). These four impurities (A, B, C and G) were qualified by their 
presence in batches of active substance used in the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies, and in the 
case of quaternized 3-(R)-quinuclidinol (LAS34823) and dithienylglycolic acid (LAS34850), because they 
are the main alcohol and acid metabolites of aclidinium. Both metabolites are also formed in the lung by 
non-enzymatic (chemical) hydrolysis and therefore are also qualified with respect to local toxicity in the 
lung. Additional non-genotoxic impurities are limited at ≤0.10% and therefore do not require 
qualification. 
Formoterol fumarate dihydrate 
Formoterol fumarate dihydrate used in the studies complies with the requirements set forth in the Ph. Eur. 
Formoterol impurities A, B, C, D, F and I exceed the qualification threshold (≥0.15%), however they have 
been qualified in toxicity studies conducted in support of the formoterol monotherapy. None of the 
formoterol impurities has structural alerts for genotoxicity. On the other hand, the low therapeutic dose 
of formoterol implies that patients will be exposed to extremely low levels of these impurities, well below 
the standard TTC of 1.5 μg/day. Potential genotoxic impurities associated with the aclidinium component 
are controlled below the TTC and the limits of other named impurities of both the formoterol and 
aclidinium active substances are in line with pharmacopeial monographs or have been qualified in toxicity 
studies conducted in support of the monotherapies. No further toxicological qualification of impurities is 
required by the CHMP. 
Carcinogenicity 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 27/136 
 
 
 
 
 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with aclidinium/formoterol since both individual active 
substances have been comprehensively investigated. The lack of carcinogenicity studies with the 
proposed combination is accepted by the CHMP. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive or developmental toxicity studies have been conducted with aclidinium/formoterol since 
both individual active substances have been comprehensively investigated. The lack of reproduction and 
developmental toxicity studies with the proposed combination has been adequately justified and is 
therefore acceptable by the CHMP.  The known effects of beta agonists and muscarinic antagonists on 
reproduction at high doses are adequately reflected in the SmPC section 5.3. Effects of aclidinium in 
nonclinical studies with respect to reproductive toxicity (fetotoxic effects) and fertility (slight decreases in 
conception rate, number of corpora lutea, and pre- and post-implantation losses) were observed only at 
exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indication to be of little 
relevance to clinical use. 
Formoterol showed reduced fertility (implantation losses) in rats, as well as decreased early postnatal 
survival and birth weight with high systemic exposure to formoterol. A slight increase in the incidence of 
uterine leiomyomas has been observed in rats and mice; an effect which is considered to be a class-effect 
in rodents after long-term exposure to high doses of β 2-adrenoreceptor agonists. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Please refer to the repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance studies have been conducted with aclidinium/formoterol since both individual active 
substances have been comprehensively investigated. Local tolerance of the combination of aclidinium and 
formoterol has been adequately investigated in the 4-week and 13-week repeated-dose toxicity studies. 
The lack of specific local tolerance studies is therefore accepted by the CHMP.  
Other toxicity studies 
No antigenicity studies have been conducted with aclidinium/formoterol since both individual active 
substances have been comprehensively investigated. The lack of antigenicity studies with the 
combination product is therefore accepted by the CHMP. 
No immunogenicity toxicity studies have been conducted with aclidinium/formoterol since both individual 
active substances have been comprehensively investigated. The lack of immunogenicity studies with the 
combination product is therefore accepted by the CHMP.

The PEC surfacewater value for both formoterol and aclidinium bromide is below the action limit of 0.01 
µg/L and neither is likely to be a PBT substance as the log Kow value for both actives does not exceed 4.5. 
Therefore neither formoterol nor aclidinium bromide is expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new primary or secondary pharmacology studies have been conducted with the proposed combination 
which is acceptable given that the pharmacology of both actives, aclidinium and formoterol, has been

extensively characterised. Bronchodilation is achieved by two separate mechanisms of action – aclidinium 
is a cholinergic antagonist while formoterol is a long-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonist.  
Two non-GLP cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies have been conducted to investigate ventricular 
tachycardia findings in the 13-week combination toxicity study. No evidence of synergistic or additive 
cardiovascular effects was seen and it is likely that the ventricular tachycardia seen in both the safety 
pharmacology studies and the repeated-dose toxicity studies can be attributed to the formoterol 
component. Adequate safety margins exist between the exposures at which these effects were seen and 
those that can be achieved through clinical use. While it is not ideal that these studies were not conducted 
in accordance with GLP, it is considered that no useful information would be obtained by repeating the 
studies. Based on the fact that no additive or synergistic effect on cardiovascular parameters were seen 
following dosing of the combination at the clinical ratio and that VT is a known effect of β2-adrenergic 
receptor agonists at high doses it is considered that no further useful information will be gained by 
repeating the studies.  
As the PK profiles of both actives have been previously characterised, no additional studies with individual 
active substances have been provided. In addition, given the different metabolic profiles and apparent 
lack of interaction from TK and clinical exposure data, no further PK studies with the combination are 
considered necessary. 
The toxicological profiles of both aclidinium and formoterol as individual substances have been 
characterised previously. Two pivotal repeated-dose inhalation toxicity studies of 4 and 13-weeks 
duration have been conducted in dogs with the combination in the same ratio as proposed clinically. In 
both studies dose-dependent cardiac effects were attributed to the formoterol component of the 
combination. The ventricular tachycardia observed following administration of high doses of formoterol 
were not associated with microscopic changes in the 13-week study. In the 13-week study, the NOAEL 
was considered to be 100/6 μg/kg/day of aclidinium/formoterol which is associated with safety margins of 
14 and 9 times the aclidinium exposure and 20 and 8 times the formoterol exposure based on Cmax and 
AUC respectively, at the clinical maximum recommended daily dose. 
The non-clinical sections of the SmPC adequately reflect available data with both the individual active 
substances and the combination. 
No new impurities have been identified for the combination product and no toxicological qualification of 
any impurity associated with either of the individual actives is required. 
Neither formoterol nor aclidinium bromide is expected to pose a risk to the environment as the PEC 
surfacewater values for both actives are below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. In addition neither aclidinium 
nor formoterol is likely to be a PBT substance 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The overall non-clinical development programme of the aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate 
dihydrate fixed dose combination was considered adequate to support the recommendation for a 
marketing authorisation for Brimica Genuair. The available non-clinical data including the results obtained 
from the repeat dose toxicity studies with Brimica Genuair and the environmental risk assessment did not 
raise any particular safety issue. Based on the available non-clinical safety data with the two compounds, 
aclidinium bromide and formoterol, it is concluded that the fixed dose combination should be well 
tolerated when used in human at the proposed dosage.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
As the clinical pharmacology of aclidinium and formoterol monotherapies is known, the primary purpose 
of the clinical pharmacology programme was to rule out any PK interaction between the individual 
components of aclidinium/formoterol (M/40464/02). The clinical pharmacology programme also enabled 
the steady-state PK of aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg BID to be determined (LAC-PK-01) as well as 
allowing the formoterol PK profiles obtained following administration of aclidinium/formoterol and 
Foradil® Aerolizer® to be characterised (M/273FO/22 and LAC-PK-01). Limited supporting data on the 
PK profile of aclidinium/formoterol are provided by LAC-MD-24. From the pharmacokinetic studies 
presented in the dossier there is no evidence of an interaction between aclidinium and formoterol when 
administered via the one inhaler. 
Analytical methods 
Bioanalytical  methods  for  the  analysis  of  both  aclidinium  (and  its  metabolites)  and  formoterol  were 
successfully  validated  and  reliably  applied  to  the  analysis  of  plasma  samples  collected  in  the  clinical 
studies  (M/273FO/22,  LAC-MD-24,  M/40464/02  and  LAC-PK-01).  The  results  obtained  during  the 
validation  in  terms  of  selectivity,  linearity,  quantitation  limit,  intra-  and  inter-batch  precision  and 
accuracy,  recovery,  stability,  dilution  effect  and  matrix  effect  demonstrated  the  suitability  of  these 
methods  for  the  quantitative  measurements  of  all  analytes  in  human  plasma  within  the  validated 
concentration range of each analyte. The validation of the analytical methods was in accordance with the 
EMA  Guideline  on  Bioanalytical  Method  Validation:  EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009.  Incurred  sample 
reanalyses for both aclidinium (and its metabolites) and formoterol conducted for studies LAC-PK-01 and 
M/40464/02  showed  that  the  analytical  methods  provided  accurate  and  reproducible  plasma 
concentration data for PK studies. 
Absorption  
Plasma concentrations observed following inhalation of aclidinium reflect mainly pulmonary absorption 
because the gastrointestinal absorption of the swallowed fraction is negligible. Conversely, it is likely that 
approximately 90% of inhaled formoterol is swallowed and, at least 65% of the swallowed fraction is 
absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Given the different sites of absorption of aclidinium and formoterol, 
an interaction between aclidinium and formoterol at the level of absorption is unlikely. However the 
applicant has conducted several pharmacokinetic studies to characterise any interaction between the 
actives when inhaled in a combination inhaler.

Bioavailability 
Study M/40464/02 
A Phase I, randomised, open label, 3-way crossover clinical study to assess the PK, safety and 
tolerability of a single dose of aclidinium/formoterol fixed-dose combination compared with 
individual components in healthy subjects. 
This was the key study for evaluation of the effect of aclidinium and formoterol on each other’s respective 
PK profile. The single-dose PK of aclidinium/formoterol were evaluated and compared to aclidinium and

formoterol monotherapies all administered via the Genuair inhaler. The study was conducted at one site 
in Germany.  
A total of 30 healthy subjects, aged between 19 years and 44 years were randomly allocated to one of six 
treatment sequences according to a balanced (1:1:1:1:1:1) randomisation. Each sequence included all 
three treatments, one per treatment period: 
•  aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg via Genuair, 
•  aclidinium monotherapy 400 μg via Genuair, 
• 
formoterol monotherapy 12 μg via Genuair 
Each subject received one administration of investigational medicinal product (IMP) per treatment period. 
Each treatment period was separated by a washout period of at least 7 days and no more than 14 days. 
A follow-up assessment (visit or phone contact) was performed 14 days after the last inhalation of IMP. 
For all subjects, blood samples for plasma PK of formoterol and/or aclidinium (and metabolites) were 
taken prior to dosing and at 5 minutes (min), 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h, 16 
h and 24 h following the morning IMP administration per treatment period. Plasma samples were analysed 
for formoterol and aclidinium (and its metabolites) by liquid chromatography with tandem mass 
spectrometric detection (LC/MS/MS). Assay lower limits of quantification (LLOQs) were 0.5 pg/mL for 
formoterol and 5.0 pg/mL for aclidinium and its metabolite LAS34823 and 91.6 pg/mL for its metabolite 
LAS34850. 
Results 
Of 30 randomised healthy subjects, 29 subjects completed the study (one subject discontinued the study 
due to personal reasons after the first treatment period [formoterol 12 μg]).

Formoterol PK parameters were subject to a moderate to high degree of inter-individual variability 
(coefficients of variation [CV%] ranged between 20% and 48%). 
Plasma concentrations of formoterol increased rapidly following a single inhalation of either 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg or formoterol 12 μg with a median time to peak plasma levels (tmax) 
occurring within 5 min post-dose (first kinetic time point) with both treatments. Mean peak plasma levels 
(Cmax) were higher with aclidinium/formoterol than with formoterol monotherapy (relative bioavailability 
of 118%). Plasma levels thereafter declined with both treatments so that mean values were below the 
limit of quantification by 16 h post-dose. The mean elimination half-life (t½) was slightly longer with 
aclidinium/formoterol than with formoterol monotherapy. However the mean area under the plasma 
concentration versus time curve for the dosing interval (AUC0-t) was comparable following either a single 
inhaled dose of aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg or a single inhaled dose of formoterol monotherapy 12 
μg.

Inter-individual variability was higher for aclidinium PK parameters (CV% ranged from 107% for the 
[terminal] elimination rate constant [λz] to 37% for apparent volume of distribution [Vz/f]) than for 
formoterol PK parameters as described above. In addition, for significant proportions of the patients, 
some of the aclidinium PK parameters, notably total body clearance (CL/f), λz, t½ and Vz/f were not 
calculable. 
As with formoterol the Cmax and tmax are increased in the aclidinium/formoterol period compared with 
aclidinium alone but both parameters were subject to high inter-individual variability. For both treatments 
the plasma concentrations of aclidinium declined rapidly and were below the LLOQ by 12 hours post dose. 
As t½ was calculable following both treatments of this crossover study in only a few patients , it is not 
possible to draw conclusions about possible trends in this parameter with aclidinium/formoterol. The 
relative aclidinium bioavailability for aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg was 126% based on mean Cmax 
and 103% based on mean AUC0-t. 
Metabolites 
Aclidinium is rapidly and extensively hydrolysed to pharmacologically inactive alcohol- (LAS34823) and 
carboxylic acid derivatives (LAS34850). The extent of plasma exposure (based on AUC0-t) to LAS34823 
and LAS34850 following administration of aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg was 3-fold and 106-fold that 
of aclidinium. 
The design and methodology of this study is appropriate for the objectives and the washout between 
periods is considered to be adequate. The study has demonstrated a similar plasma concentration profile 
for aclidinium and formoterol in combination as that of the monocomponents. A small increase in Cmax and 
t1/2 of both actives when in combination suggests some interaction in absorption and elimination but the 
levels are such that they are unlikely to give rise to serious safety concerns.  
Study LAC-PK-01 
This is a Phase IIa, randomised, open-label, 2-way crossover study to determine the PK, 
safety, and tolerability of aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg via Genuair® and formoterol 12 
μg via Foradil® Aerolizer® in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease 
The objectives of study LAC-PK-01 were to assess the PK, safety and tolerability of aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 μg BID administered via Genuair® and of formoterol 12 μg administered via Foradil® Aerolizer® 
(sourced from the US market). This study established the PK safety bridge at steady state of 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg compared to US Foradil® Aerolizer® 12 μg. It was conducted in one site 
in the USA and a total of 24 patients, aged between 42 years and 70 years with moderate or severe COPD 
(according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease [GOLD] classification) were 
randomly allocated to one of two treatment sequences, according to a balanced 1:1 randomisation. Each 
patient received both treatments, one in each of the two treatment periods: 
•  aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg BID via Genuair®, 
• 
formoterol monotherapy 12 μg BID via US Foradil® Aerolizer®. 
The duration of each treatment period was 4.5 days (i.e. BID treatment for 4 days followed by a final dose 
of IMP in the morning of Day 5). Each treatment period was separated by a 7 day washout period. 
Blood samples for plasma PK of formoterol and aclidinium (and its metabolites) were taken on Day 1 and 
Day 5 of each treatment period, prior to dosing, and at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 
6 h, 8 h and 12 h (5 min before the evening dose) following the morning IMP administration. Blood

samples for PK testing were also taken on Day 2 to Day 4 of each treatment period prior to dosing and at 
5 min and 15 min following the morning and evening IMP administration. Plasma samples were analysed 
for formoterol and aclidinium (and its metabolites) by LC/MS/MS. Assay LLOQs were 0.5 pg/mL for 
formoterol and 5.0 pg/mL for aclidinium and its metabolite LAS34823 and 91.6 pg/mL for its metabolite 
LAS34850. The primary outcome measure of these analyses was the Day 5 (steady state) plasma PK of 
formoterol, while the secondary outcome measure was the Day 1 plasma PK of formoterol.

Steady state plasma levels were achieved within 5 days of BID dosing with either aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 μg or with Foradil® Aerolizer® 12 μg as shown by comparable trough plasma concentrations 
morning and evening on Day 4 (3.82 pg/mL [CV 34.4%] and 4.15 pg/mL [CV 52.0%], respectively) and 
Day 5 (3.95 pg/mL [CV 32.6%] and 3.88 pg/mL [CV 29.2%], respectively). 
Formoterol PK parameters were similar with aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg to those observed with 
Foradil® Aerolizer® 12 μg, with the exception of median tmax, which was shorter when formoterol was 
administered as aclidinium/formoterol (p=0.006 for comparison at steady state). As formoterol is not 
intended for relief of acute symptoms this shorter Tmax will have little clinical relevance.

Mean steady state accumulation ratios observed with Foradil® Aerolizer® or aclidinium/formoterol were 
1.92 (CV 23.3%) and 1.85 (CV 29.3%), respectively, based on Cmax and 2.15 (CV 17.2%) and 2.04 (CV 
11.9%), respectively, based on AUC0- t. Co-administration of aclidinium had no apparent effect on the 
accumulation of formoterol. The higher than expected accumulation ratios may reflect increased 
pulmonary absorption at steady state as a consequence of reduced obstruction.

As for formoterol, values for Cmax and AUC of aclidinium were higher on Day 5 than following the first dose 
with mean accumulation ratios being 1.38 (CV 35.4%) based on Cmax and 1.95 (CV% 28.8) based on AUC. 
The aclidinium accumulation ratio (based on mean AUC) was slightly higher than expected; an 
observation which may reflect improved pulmonary absorption secondary to improved lung function with 
repeat administration. 
The conduct of this study was acceptable and the washout period of 7 days between treatments is 
appropriate to the half-lives of aclidinium and formoterol. The main objective of this study was to bridge

between the formoterol as delivered via Genuair and the currently licensed formoterol, Foradil Aerolizer. 
In that respect the study has demonstrated similar bioavailability from the two delivery systems so that 
the efficacy and safety that is known regarding Foradil Aerolizer can be informative as to the expected 
efficacy and safety that should be seen with aclidinium/formoterol Genuair. However, as the Foradil used 
in this study was sourced from the US market a further study (M/273FO/22) was conducted using 
EU-sourced Foradil. 
Comparing the two studies (M/40464/02 and LAK-PK-01), the bioavailability of formoterol is similar in 
patients with COPD to that in healthy volunteers as demonstrated by Cmax and AUC0-∞ whereas the 
bioavailability of aclidinium is lower in patients with COPD; Cmax 102 vs 270pg/ml, AUC0-∞ 280.4 vs 
406pg.h/ml. However AUC0-∞ was only calculable in a small number of healthy volunteers (5) in study 
M/40464/02 and AUC0-t was similar in healthy volunteers and in patients with COPD (229 pg.h/ml vs 
228.3 pg.h/ml). 
Study M/273FO/22 
A Phase IIa, randomised, evaluator-blinded, 4-way crossover clinical study to assess the PK, 
safety, tolerability and effects on lung function of one days treatment of formoterol 12 μg OD 
via two different inhalers (Aerolizer® and Genuair®), of aclidinium/formoterol 200/12 μg via 
Genuair® and of formoterol 12 μg BID via Aerolizer® in patients with moderate to severe 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
This study was conducted in two sites in Germany and used EU-sourced Foradil Aerolizer®.  
A total of 24 patients aged between 40 years and 80 years with stable moderate or severe COPD 
(according to GOLD classification), and a baseline mean FEV1 across treatment periods ranging from 1.30 
L to 1.39 L, were randomly allocated to one of four treatment sequences according to a balanced 1:1:1:1 
randomisation. The duration of each treatment period was 48 h, of which patients received treatment for 
one day only. Patients received each of the four treatments to be tested: 
• 
formoterol monotherapy 12 μg via Genuair® OD in the morning and placebo via Genuair® OD in 
the evening, 
• 
formoterol monotherapy 12 μg via EU Foradil® Aerolizer® OD in the morning and placebo via 
Genuair® OD in the evening, 
• 
formoterol monotherapy 12 μg BID via EU Foradil® Aerolizer®, 
•  aclidinium/formoterol 200/12 μg OD in the morning and placebo OD in the evening; both via 
Genuair®. 
The washout period between treatment periods was 7 days. A follow-up assessment was performed at 
least 7 days after the last inhalation of IMP. 
For all patients, blood samples for PK testing of formoterol and aclidinium were taken prior to dosing and 
at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h following the morning dose per treatment 
period. Additional blood samples for PK testing were taken at 12 h 5 min, 12 h 15 min, 12 h 30 min, 13 
h, 16 h and 36 h for patients in the formoterol BID treatment period. Plasma samples were analysed for 
formoterol and aclidinium (and its metabolites) by LC/MS/MS. Assay LLOQs were 0.5 pg/mL for 
formoterol, 5.0 pg/mL for aclidinium and its metabolite LAS34823 and 100.0 pg/mL for aclidinium 
metabolite LAS34850.

Inter-individual variability in the values for PK parameters for formoterol ranged from moderate to very 
high (CVs in the range 24.4% to 107.0%), as expected with the inhalation route of administration. 
Both Cmax and AUC0-24 of formoterol were generally comparable when formoterol was administered via 
Genuair® compared to when it was administered via Foradil Aerolizer (relative bioavailability based on 
AUC0-24 of 86.4% [n=23; SD 25.1; CV 29.1%]). Plasma concentrations of formoterol declined in a 
biexponential fashion irrespective of inhaler device. 
Based on AUC0-24, the relative bioavailability of formoterol administered as aclidinium/formoterol 200/12 
μg via Genuair compared to Foradil Aerolizer 12 μg was 77.1% (n=21; SD=29.4; CV 38.1%).

Adjusted mean changes from pre-dose in FEV1 AUC0-12/12h and in peak FEV1 were comparable 
irrespective of whether formoterol monotherapy 12 μg OD was administered via Genuair or Foradil 
Aerolizer indicating that both formoterol 12 μg via Genuair and Foradil Aerolizer have comparable PD 
efficacy. 
This study was conducted using a dose of 200µg of aclidinium with 12 µg of formoterol in a once-daily 
regimen. It is therefore not representative of the proposed strength to be marketed but does inform on 
the relative bioavailability of formoterol via the Genuair inhaler compared with administration from the EU 
Foradil Aerolizer. In fact in this patient population a lower bioavailability was demonstrated for formoterol 
administered via the Genuair inhaler than via the Foradil Aerolizer which could have efficacy implications. 
Investigation of the pharmacodynamics of aclidinium/formoterol was a secondary objective of this study 
but the effect on FEV1 of formoterol 12µg administered via Genuair was similar to that of formoterol 12 µg 
administered via Foradil Aerolizer. In this study the effect of adding 200 µg aclidinium to formoterol was 
minimal and not clinically relevant. However it was a low dose of aclidinium compared with the proposed 
dose of 400 µg BID. 
LAC-MD-24 
A randomised, double blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, 4-week pilot study 
to assess symptoms in stable, moderate-to-severe COPD patients taking aclidinium bromide 
200 μg once daily in combination with formoterol fumarate 12 μg once or twice daily versus 
formoterol fumarate 12 μg twice daily. 
This randomised, double-blind, parallel group study was conducted at 31 centres in the US. A total of 156 
patients aged between 41 years and 80 years with stable moderate or severe COPD (according to GOLD 
Assessment report

classification) and a baseline mean FEV1 across treatment groups ranging from 1.23 L to 1.35 L, were 
randomly allocated to one of the following three treatment groups in a ratio of 2:2:1 as follows: 
•  Aclidinium/formoterol 200/12 μg OD in the morning and placebo OD in the evening via Genuair, 
•  Aclidinium/formoterol 200/12 μg OD in the morning and formoterol monotherapy 12 μg OD in the 
evening via Genuair, 
• 
Formoterol monotherapy 12 μg BID via Genuair. 
Patients received study drug treatment for up to 4 weeks. The final follow-up assessment (by telephone) 
was performed 7 days after the last inhalation of study drug. 
PK testing was performed on a subset (approximately 20%) of patients only. Blood samples for evaluation 
of formoterol PK were collected on Day 1 and on Day 29, prior to dosing and at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 
h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h (prior to the evening dose), 12 h 5 min, 12 h 15 min, 12 h 30 min, 13 h, 14 h, 16 
h and 24 h following the morning IMP administration. Plasma samples were analysed by LC-MS/MS (assay 
LLOQ was 0.5 pg/mL). 
Results 
This study was primarily an exploratory safety and efficacy study and gives little meaningful information 
on the PK of aclidinium/formoterol as PK data are available from only 10 patients. 
A moderate to high degree of variability was observed across all treatment groups for most PK 
parameters (CVs ranged from 13.1% to 224.8%). The very high variability noted for some PK parameters 
is likely to be a consequence of evaluation of low patient numbers within a parallel group study. No 
meaningful differences between treatment groups in PK parameters were observed on either Day 1 or on 
Day 29. 
Values for formoterol steady state PK parameters between aclidinium/formoterol 200/12 μg and 
formoterol monotherapy 12 μg (administered via Genuair) were broadly comparable. While the Cmax was 
slightly higher with aclidinium/formoterol than with formoterol monotherapy, the t½ was lower with 
aclidinium/formoterol than with formoterol monotherapy. 
• 
Influence of food 
As aclidinium/formoterol is administered via the inhalation route and acts locally in the lungs no food 
interaction studies have been conducted. This is regarded acceptable by the CHMP. 
Distribution 
The very high values for the apparent volume of distribution (Vz/f) observed for both aclidinium and 
formoterol in patients with COPD (LAC-PK-01 and M/273FO/22) and healthy subjects (M/40464/22) are 
consistent with the low bioavailability associated with inhaled administration. 
Whole lung deposition of inhaled aclidinium via Genuair® averaged approximately 30% of the metered 
dose (Aclidinium bromide PAR).  
Plasma protein binding 
No plasma protein binding studies have been conducted with aclidinium/formoterol. Due to the rapid 
chemical and non-chemical hydrolysis of aclidinium in plasma, it is likely that the protein binding of 
aclidinium measured in in vitro studies corresponded to the protein binding of the 
pharmacologically-inactive metabolites of aclidinium (87% for the acid metabolite [LAS34850] and 15% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 41/136 
 
 
 
 
 
for the alcohol metabolite [LAS34823]) rather than that of aclidinium itself. It was also shown in in vitro 
studies that the main plasma protein that binds aclidinium is albumin. Although the extent of plasma 
protein binding of aclidinium is unknown, its rapid hydrolysis such that only 0.1% of the inhaled dose is 
excreted unchanged in the urine (Eklira Genuair SmPC), makes the possibility of displacement 
interactions with aclidinium unlikely even if its plasma protein binding was high. 
The plasma protein binding of formoterol is known to be in the range of 61−64 % (34 % primarily to 
albumin) with no saturation of binding sites in the concentration range reached with therapeutic doses 
(Foradil SmPC). As the plasma protein binding of formoterol is relatively low, there is little possibility of 
displacement interactions with formoterol. 
It is accepted that the plasma protein binding of aclidinium cannot be characterised accurately due to its 
rapid metabolism into its two inactive metabolites. Formoterol has not been investigated in patients with 
severe renal impairment but the extent of plasma protein binding of formoterol is relatively low and 
therefore renal impairment is unlikely to give rise to displacement interactions. 
Elimination 
•  Metabolism 
The metabolism of aclidinium bromide and formoterol fumarate has been previously characterised and 
described in their respective SmPCs. It is known that the major route of metabolism of aclidinium is 
hydrolysis, which occurs both chemically (non-enzymatically) and enzymatically by esterases 
(butyrylcholinesterase is the main human enzyme involved in the hydrolysis).  Aclidinium is rapidly and 
extensively hydrolysed to its acid and alcohol derivatives, neither of which binds to muscarinic receptors 
and both of which are apparently devoid of pharmacologic activity. Biotransformation via cytochrome 
P450 (CYP450) enzymes plays a minor role in the total metabolic clearance of aclidinium. The low 
absolute bioavailability of inhaled aclidinium (<5%) is because aclidinium undergoes extensive systemic 
and pre-systemic hydrolysis whether deposited in the lung or swallowed. 
Formoterol is eliminated primarily by metabolism. Direct glucuronidation is the major pathway of 
biotransformation, while another pathway involves O-demethylation followed by glucuronidation (Foradil 
SmPC). Minor pathways involve sulphate conjugation of formoterol and deformylation followed by 
sulphate conjugation. Multiple isozymes catalyze the O-demethylation (CYP2D6, 2C19, 2C9, and 2A6) of 
formoterol, and so consequently the potential for metabolic drug-drug interactions is low. 
Aclidinium is rapidly metabolised to form two inactive metabolites by hydrolysis, whereas formoterol is 
metabolised via several pathways catalysed by multiple isoenzymes. Given that the biotransformation of 
aclidinium and formoterol occur via different processes, a metabolic interaction between these two 
products is highly unlikely. Therefore interactions between the two actives are unlikely. It is accepted by 
the CHMP that further studies of the metabolism of these actives have not been undertaken. 
• 
Excretion 
The abnormally high values for aclidinium total body clearance from plasma (Cl/F) observed with inhaled 
aclidinium/formoterol in patients with COPD (1300 L/h at steady-state in LAC-PK-01 and 5327 L/h 
following a single dose in M/273FO/22) and healthy subjects (1468 L/h following a single dose in 
M/40464/02) are consistent with its very low bioavailability. The Cl/F of formoterol was also high (152 L/h 
in LAC-PK-01, 298 L/h in M/40464/02 and 496 L/h in M/273FO/22) although markedly lower than that of 
aclidinium. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 42/136 
 
 
 
 
 
Following tmax, plasma levels of aclidinium and formoterol declined rapidly. Mean aclidinium t½ following 
aclidinium/formoterol administration was between 1.5 h and 5.0 h in patients with COPD (M/273FO/22, 
LAC-PK-01) and was 8.9 h in healthy subjects (M/40464/02) while mean formoterol t½ was between 4.9 
h and 8.2 h in patients with COPD (LAC-PK-01, M/273FO/22, LAC-MD-24) and was 7.1 h in healthy 
subjects (M/40464/02). Inter-individual variability of t½ in each of aclidinium/formoterol studies was 
higher for aclidinium (coefficients of variation [CVs] ranged between 53% and 93%) than for formoterol 
(CVs between 25% and 50%).  
Following inhalation of aclidinium 400 μg by healthy subjects or patients with COPD, the urinary excretion 
of unchanged aclidinium was very low at about 0.1% of the administered dose, indicating that renal 
clearance plays a very minor role in the total aclidinium clearance from plasma. Renal clearance also plays 
a minor part in the elimination of inhaled formoterol 12 μg, with approximately 6% to 9% of the delivered 
dose of inhaled formoterol excreted in the urine as unchanged formoterol and direct conjugates of 
formoterol. 
It is accepted that the elimination pathways of aclidinium bromide and formoterol fumarate are well 
known. The pharmacokinetic studies that have been conducted have not demonstrated any interaction 
between the actives affecting their elimination. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
• 
Dose proportionality 
Dose proportionality for the two actives is accepted by the CHMP. There is no evidence of a PK interaction 
when administered in a FDC so dose proportionality of the combination is also accepted. 
In vitro studies have demonstrated dose proportionality of the aerodynamic behaviour of aclidinium 200 
μg and 400 μg inhalation powder and formoterol 6 μg and 12 μg inhalation powder in fixed combinations. 
In study M/273FO/22 the mean AUC0-24 of formoterol BID administered via Foradil Aerolizer (83.2 
pg.h/mL [CV 32.1%]) was approximately 2-fold higher than that obtained with single doses of formoterol 
via Genuair (36.2 pg.h/mL [CV 32.2%]) indicating dose proportionality for formoterol. 
• 
Time dependency 
In the PK studies with aclidinium/formoterol the same observed mean t ½ following the first dose of 
aclidinium/formoterol and at steady state suggests that clearance remains constant with repeat 
administration and that the PK of aclidinium is time-independent. There is no evidence of time dependent 
kinetics of aclidinium or formoterol from the PK studies presented in the dossier. The lack of time 
dependency has been previously accepted for aclidinium bromide monotherapy. 
Special populations 
The applicant has not conducted any further studies in special populations as the proposed combination 
product contains two known active substances. From the known pharmacokinetics of the actives no dose 
adjustment is required for intrinsic factors such as age or for patients with renal or hepatic impairment. 
The applicant’s justification for this is accepted by the CHMP. Section 5.2 of the SmPC states that there 
are no data to support the use of formoterol in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014

• 
Impaired renal function 
Urinary excretion of inhaled aclidinium is very low with only 0.1% of the inhaled dose excreted unchanged 
in the urine. As may be expected, no significant differences in aclidinium PK parameters between subjects 
with normal renal function and subjects with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment were observed in 
a clinical study designed to evaluate the influence of renal impairment on the PK of aclidinium. 
As aclidinium undergoes rapid hydrolysis in plasma and the renal excretion of unchanged aclidinium is 
very low, it is unlikely that the extent of plasma protein binding of aclidinium would have a relevant 
impact on unbound plasma concentrations of aclidinium, even in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Consequently, plasma protein binding of aclidinium has not been determined. 
Renal clearance plays a minor role in the elimination of inhaled formoterol, with only 6% to 9% of the total 
dose eliminated unchanged in the urine (Foradil SmPC). Consequently, it is unlikely that renal impairment 
would have a significant effect on the PK of formoterol and clinical studies to investigate the influence of 
renal impairment on formoterol PK have not been conducted for either formoterol administered via 
Genuair® or for marketed formoterol monotherapy products. 
As the product contains two known actives of which the pharmacokinetics have been previously 
characterised and neither of which is renally excreted to a significant extent, it is accepted by the CHMP 
that no further studies in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. 
• 
Impaired hepatic function 
As hepatic metabolism plays a very minor role in the elimination of aclidinium, hepatic dysfunction is not 
expected to have a relevant influence on its PK of aclidinium. Clinical studies to investigate the effects of 
hepatic impairment on the PK of aclidinium have, therefore, not been conducted. 
Clinical studies to investigate the effects of hepatic impairment on the PK of formoterol have not been 
conducted. Formoterol is eliminated primarily via hepatic metabolism, the major pathway being direct 
glucuronidation while O-demethylation followed by glucuronidation is another pathway. In cirrhotic 
patients, oxidative metabolism is likely to be slower but conjugation capacity should essentially be 
maintained as glucuronidation appears to be little affected by cirrhosis. Furthermore, reduced capacity of 
O-demethylation may be metabolically compensated for by glucuronidation as the capacity to 
glucuronidate is high. Thus, cirrhosis should not a priori be expected to reduce the capacity to eliminate 
formoterol. Although increased exposure to formoterol is possible in patients with severe liver cirrhosis, 
dose adjustment is not required. 
As the product contains two known actives of which the pharmacokinetics have been previously 
characterised it is accepted by the CHMP that no further studies in patients with hepatic impairment have 
been conducted. 
• 
Elderly 
No significant differences in systemic exposure to aclidinium between young patients with COPD (40 
years to 59 years) and elderly patients with COPD (aged 70 years and over) were observed in a clinical 
study designed to assess the influence of age on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of aclidinium. Furthermore, 
increased age had no clinically relevant effect on the safety or effectiveness of aclidinium monotherapy in 
the pooled population of placebo-controlled Phase III studies. On the basis of currently available data for 
aclidinium, no dosage adjustment in geriatric patients is warranted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 44/136 
 
 
 
 
 
The PK of formoterol has not been studied in the elderly population. However, two pivotal, controlled 
studies of formoterol in patients with COPD showed no overall differences in the safety and effectiveness 
between patients aged 65 years or older or aged 75 years or older and younger patients 
As the pharmacokinetics of the two actives have been previously characterised and as neither active is 
eliminated unchanged via the renal route to any great extent it is accepted that the applicant does not 
need to conduct further studies in elderly patients and that no dose adjustment will be needed for elderly 
patients. 
• 
Children 
The proposed indication of COPD is not relevant to the paediatric population. Therefore no studies have 
been conducted in the paediatric population. 
A class waiver from the European Paediatric Regulation (Regulation [EC] Number 1901/2006) has been 
granted for the condition COPD. Aclidinium/formoterol is indicated for adult patients only. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No additional drug-drug interactions were warranted by the CHMP on the basis of the information 
currently available from previous aclidinium and formoterol in vitro and in vivo studies. These have 
suggested that no specific drug-drug interaction is to be expected and the theoretical interactions from 
the known pharmacodynamics effects of the two active substances are included in SmPC section 4.5. 
• 
In vitro 
In vitro studies have shown that neither aclidinium at the therapeutic dose, nor the metabolites of 
aclidinium, are expected to cause interactions with P-glycoprotein substrate drugs or drugs metabolised 
by esterases or CYP450 enzymes (Eklira Genuair SmPC) 
In vitro studies have shown that formoterol does not inhibit cytochrome P450 isozymes at therapeutically 
relevant concentrations (Foradil US Prescribing Information) 
• 
In vivo 
Although no formal in vivo drug interaction studies have been performed with aclidinium, it has been used 
concomitantly with other medicinal products used for the treatment of COPD including sympathomimetic 
bronchodilators, methylxanthines and oral/inhaled corticosteroids without clinical evidence of drug 
interactions. Co-administration of aclidinium with other anticholinergic-containing medicinal products has 
not been studied and is not recommended as it may result in potentiation of undesirable anticholinergic 
effects (Eklira Genuair SmPC). 
No formal in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with formoterol monotherapy. 
Nevertheless, caution is advised in the concomitant use of formoterol with other long-acting 
sympathomimetic medicinal products, with medicinal products known to be associated with 
hypokalaemia (such as methylxanthine derivatives, steroids or non-potassium-sparing diuretics) or with 
medicinal products known to prolong QTc interval (such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic 
antidepressants and macrolides). In addition, β-adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect 
of β2-adrenergic agonists. 
Potential drug-drug interactions for each of aclidinium and formoterol monotherapies do not overlap.

Aclidinium bromide is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) while formoterol fumarate dihydrate is 
a long-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA). 
Sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways mediate bronchoconstriction in COPD. Muscarinic 
antagonists, such as aclidinium bromide, and β2-adrenergic agonists, such as formoterol fumarate 
dihydrate, each cause smooth muscle relaxation in the airways, leading to airway expansion and 
improved lung function, albeit via different mechanisms. Anticholinergic compounds block the muscarinic 
acetylcholine M3-receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and β2-adrenergic agonists stimulate 
β2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle. Combinations of muscarinic antagonists and 
β2-adrenergic agonists have been shown to produce significantly greater improvements in pulmonary 
function compared to the respective monotherapies, with safety/tolerability profiles similar to those of the 
individual components 
Primary pharmacology 
The primary pharmacodynamics of aclidinium/formoterol 200/12 μg OD was investigated in two early 
exploratory clinical studies conducted in patients with moderate or severe COPD (M/273FO/22 and 
LAC-MD-24). 
Both M/273FO/22 and LAC-MD-24 provided some indication that improvements in lung function 
associated with aclidinium/formoterol 200/12 μg OD via Genuair were slightly greater than those 
associated with formoterol 12 μg OD via Genuair or Foradil  Aerolizer, although the magnitude and/or 
consistency of the improvements were not robust. 
Study M/273FO/22 showed the bronchodilator efficacy (as assessed by the normalised areas under the 
FEV1 versus time curve from 0 hours to 12 hours post-dose [FEV1 AUC0-12/12h] and from 0 to 3 hours 
post-dose [FEV1 AUC0-3/3h] and peak FEV1) of formoterol 12 μg to be very similar irrespective of 
whether formoterol monotherapy was administered via Genuair or Foradil Aerolizer. 
LAC-MD-24 
A randomised, double blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, 4-week pilot study 
to assess symptoms in stable, moderate-to-severe COPD patients taking aclidinium bromide 
200 μg once daily in combination with formoterol fumarate 12 μg once or twice daily versus 
formoterol fumarate 12 μg twice daily. 
This randomised, double-blind, parallel group study was conducted at 31 centres in the US. A total of 156 
patients aged between 41 years and 80 years with stable moderate or severe COPD (according to GOLD 
classification) and a baseline mean FEV1 across treatment groups ranging from 1.23 L to 1.35 L, were 
randomly allocated to one of the following three treatment groups in a ratio of 2:2:1 as follows: 
•  Aclidinium/formoterol 200/12 μg OD in the morning and placebo OD in the evening via Genuair, 
•  Aclidinium/formoterol 200/12 μg OD in the morning and formoterol monotherapy 12 μg OD in the 
evening via Genuair, 
• 
Formoterol monotherapy 12 μg BID via Genuair. 
Patients received study drug treatment for up to 4 weeks. The final follow-up assessment (by telephone) 
was performed 7 days after the last inhalation of study drug. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 46/136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety and tolerability were evaluated by recording of AEs, clinical laboratory measures, physical 
examinations, vital signs and 12-lead ECGs (plus 24 h Holter monitoring in a subset of patients). 
All 156 randomised patients were included in the analysis of pharmacodynamics/efficacy and COPD 
symptoms (randomised population). A total of 145 patients (93%) completed the study. Of the 11 
patients who prematurely discontinued the study, 10 patients (8.0% [10/125]) were in the 
aclidinium/formoterol treatment groups (4 discontinuations were due to protocol violations, 4 were due to 
AEs, one was lost to follow-up and one had insufficient therapeutic response) and one (3.2% [1/31]) was 
in the formoterol BID group (protocol violation). 
PD/efficacy results 
No notable differences in baseline lung function were observed between treatment groups. 
Mean changes from baseline to Day 29 in key parameters of lung function are presented for each of the 
treatment groups. 
Table 7: Changes from Baseline (L) to Day 29 in morning peak FEV1 and in the normalised 
area under the FEV1 versus time curves for 0 to 3 hours post-dose (FEV1 AUC0-3/3h) (study

Abbreviations: BID = twice daily; CI = confidence interval; FEV1 = forced expiratory volume in one second; 
FEV1 AUC0-3/3h = normalised area under the FEV1 versus time curve from 0 hours to 3 hours post-dose; 
QAM = once daily in the morning; QPM = once daily in the evening; SE = standard error. 
The changes from baseline to Day 29 in peak FEV1 and FEV1 AUC0-3/3h were slightly greater for the 
treatment groups that received aclidinium/formoterol in the morning compared to the treatment group 
that received formoterol monotherapy in the morning. This observation must, however, be interpreted 
with caution given the differences in the magnitudes of the treatment effects between the two treatment 
groups that received aclidinium/formoterol in the morning, which illustrate the between-group variability 
in PD responses observed in this exploratory parallel group study. Similar observations were made for 
changes from baseline in peak FVC and FVC AUC0-3/3h. 
COPD symptom scores improved across all treatment groups; however, there was no consistent pattern 
in the extent of improvement in scores across treatment groups. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
No effects on corrected QT (QTc) interval (corrected using the Fridericia method or individually-corrected) 
were observed in a thorough QT study in which aclidinium monotherapy (200 μg or 800 μg) was 
Assessment report

administered OD for 3 days to healthy subjects (Eklira Genuair SmPC). In addition, no clinically significant 
effects of aclidinium monotherapy 400 μg BID on cardiac rhythm were observed on 24 h Holter monitoring 
after 3 months treatment of 336 patients with COPD (of whom 164 received aclidinium and 172 received 
placebo). There is no evidence of a clinically relevant effect of aclidinium on QTc interval (Aclidinium 
bromide PAR). 
The cardiovascular safety of formoterol has been extensively documented in the literature and is 
described in the product labels (Foradil SmPC). At therapeutic doses, formoterol 12 μg BID had no 
clinically relevant acute or chronic effects on QTc interval when administered for up to 12 months in a 
pivotal, double-blind study in patients with COPD. Slight prolongation of mean QTc interval (8 msec, as 
assessed using Fridericia heart rate correction methods) was observed following inhalation of single doses 
of formoterol 120 μg (i.e. at 10-times the recommended therapeutic dose) by healthy subjects6; an 
observation which is not unexpected following administration of high doses of sympathomimetic agents. 
No important differences in ventricular or supraventricular ectopy were observed between the formoterol 
12 μg and placebo treatment groups in two pivotal, double-blind clinical studies in patients with asthma. 
The cardiac safety of aclidinium/formoterol has been assessed in Phase III studies by 12-lead ECGs and 
24 h Holter monitoring. No clinically significant effects on overall cardiac safety (including QTc interval 
[Fredericia correction method]) of aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg BID, compared to either aclidinium 
400 μg BID or formoterol 12 μg BID, were observed on 12-lead ECGs conducted in 3398 patients with 
COPD treated for up to 52 weeks in placebo- controlled Phase III studies (of whom 720 patients received 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg, 722 received aclidinium monotherapy and 716 received formoterol 
monotherapy). In addition, no clinically significant effects on cardiac rhythm of aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 μg BID compared to aclidinium 400 μg or formoterol 12 μg were observed on 24 h Holter 
monitoring after 24 weeks treatment of 551 patients with COPD (of whom 114 received 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg, 118 received aclidinium monotherapy and 112 received formoterol 
monotherapy). There is no evidence of a clinically relevant effect of aclidinium/formoterol on cardiac 
safety, above that observed with the constituent monotherapies. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
As this is an inhaled product that acts locally in the lung there is no relationship between the plasma 
concentration and the primary pharmacodynamics effect. This is agreed by the CHMP. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances  
Possible pharmacodynamics drug-drug interactions associated with aclidinium include: 
•  Co-administration of aclidinium with other anticholinergic-containing medicinal products has not 
been studied and is not recommended as it may result in potentiation of undesirable 
anticholinergic effects. 
Possible drug-drug interactions associated with formoterol include: 
•  Co-administration of formoterol with other long acting β2-adrenergic agonists is not 
recommended as it may result in potentiation of undesirable β2-adrenergic effects. 
•  Co-administration of formoterol with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or 
non-potassium-sparing diuretics may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of 
β2-adrenergic agonists. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 48/136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Co-administration of formoterol with β-adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect 
of formoterol. 
•  Co-administration of formoterol with other drugs known to prolong the QTc-interval may give rise 
to a PD interaction and increase the possible risk of ventricular arrhythmias (this is discussed 
further in relation to the safety results in the Phase III studies). 
It should be noted that the above-mentioned drug-drug interactions for formoterol are not supported by 
clinical data but are considered theoretically possible and cited in section 4.5 in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPCs) for marketed formoterol products. 
Potential drug-drug interactions for each of aclidinium and formoterol monotherapies do not overlap. 
Formal in vivo studies to assess drug-drug interactions with aclidinium/formoterol are, therefore, 
considered unnecessary by the CHMP. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
This exploratory parallel group study in a relatively small number of patients demonstrated a small 
increase in peak FEV1 and FEV1 AUC0-3h/3h in the patients receiving the combination in the morning 
compared to those receiving formoterol alone in the morning. However adding a dose of formoterol in the 
evening to the morning dose of the combination when compared with adding placebo appears to decrease 
the effect. No definite conclusions can be drawn from these results. 
The investigation of cardiac safety of aclidinium/formoterol was generally agreed by CHMP during 
scientific advice. Given the known safety profiles of the two monocomponent actives and the lack of any 
unexpected safety signals during the Phase III clinical programme it is accepted that a specific TQT study 
with the combination is not required. 
Theoretical drug:drug interactions from the known pharmacodynamics effects of the two active 
substances in aclidinium/formoterol have been described in their respective SmPCs. As they have 
different mechanisms of action and the theoretical drug:drug interactions do not overlap it is accepted 
that specific drug:drug interaction studies with the combination are not required. 
The safety of the combination compared with its monocomponents will be compared from the results of 
the Phase III studies. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
From the pharmacokinetic studies presented in the dossier there is no evidence of an interaction between 
aclidinium and formoterol when administered via one inhaler. 
Also  the  pharmacokinetics  of  formoterol  via  the  Genuair  as  monocomponent  or  in  combination  with 
aclidinium are similar to those of formoterol administered via the Aerolizer, in particular the EU sourced 
Aerolizer.  The  pharmacodynamics  of  aclidinium  bromide  and  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  are  well 
characterised and no further studies have been conducted. As the mechanisms of action of the two actives 
are different with no overlap any pharmacodynamic interaction is unlikely.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Introduction 
The clinical efficacy programme for aclidinium/formoterol comprised two Phase III pivotal studies 
(M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31) and five supportive studies: two Phase III long-term safety studies 
(LAC-MD-36 and LAC-MD-32), two Phase IIb, dose-finding studies of aclidinium/formoterol BID 
(LAC-MD-27 and M/40464/26) and one Phase IIb dose-finding study of aclidinium/formoterol OD 
(M/273FO/23). 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Study LAC-MD-27 
An efficacy and safety study of two fixed combinations of aclidinium/formoterol (400/12 μg 
and 400/6 μg) compared with aclidinium monotherapy (400 μg) and formoterol monotherapy 
(12 μg) and placebo, all administered BID, in patients with stable, moderate to severe chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease. 
This Phase IIb, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled, 4-period 
incomplete block cross-over study was conducted at 20 centres in the US. Following a 14-day run-in 
period during which the stability of the patients’ COPD was confirmed, eligible patients were randomised. 
For each patient, the study consisted of 4 periods of 14 treatment days each separated by a washout 
period of 7 to 10 days. During each period, patients received one of 5 treatments according to the 
randomisation scheme: aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg, aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg, aclidinium 400 
μg, formoterol 12 μg or placebo, all administered BID via Genuair®. The final follow-up assessment was 
performed (by phone or visit) 14 days after the last dose of IMP. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to Day 14 in FEV1 AUC0-12/12h. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
• Changes from baseline to Day 14 in morning trough FEV1 and morning peak FEV1. 
Notable additional efficacy endpoints were: 
• The above-mentioned primary and secondary endpoints for FEV1 assessed for FVC and the change from 
baseline to Day 14 in trough IC. 
• Changes from baseline in FEV1 and FVC at each time point on Day 14 of treatment. 
• Changes from baseline in the overall daily average COPD symptom scores and use of rescue medication. 
Safety and tolerability were evaluated by recording of AEs, clinical laboratory measures, physical 
examinations including assessment of blood pressure and heart rate, and 12-lead ECGs (including 
24-hour Holter monitoring).  
Of 128 randomised patients, 104 patients (81.3%) completed the study. All patients were evaluated for 
safety and efficacy (ITT population). 
Results 
Statistically significant adjusted mean treatment differences were observed between all active treatments 
and placebo in the change from baseline to Day 14 in FEV1 AUC0-12/12h (p<0.0001 for all comparisons).

Overall, the magnitudes of the treatment differences between aclidinium/formoterol and either placebo or 
the constituent monotherapies were comparable for the two aclidinium/formoterol doses.

A pre-specified sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was performed in which the changes 
from baseline to Day 14 in FEV1 AUC0-12/12h were analysed with a modified MMRM which used the baseline 
of treatment period 1, rather than the baseline of each individual treatment period to determine the 
robustness of the results. These analyses showed: 
•  Adjusted mean treatment differences between aclidinium/formoterol and placebo in the increase 
from baseline to Day 14 in FEV1 AUC0-12/12h were numerically slightly greater with the 400/12 μg 
dose (0.218 L; p<0.0001) than with the 400/6 μg dose (0.196 L; p<0.0001). 
•  Aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg and 400/6 μg were associated with statistically significantly 
greater changes from baseline to Day 14 in FEV1 AUC 0-12/12h than either aclidinium alone (0.059 
L [p<0.001] and 0.036 L [p=0.031, respectively) or formoterol alone (0.091 L [p<0.0001] and 
0.069 L [p<0.001], respectively). 
Statistically significant adjusted mean treatment differences between all active treatments and placebo in 
the changes from baseline to Day 14 in both trough FEV1 and peak FEV1 were observed. Statistically 
significant adjusted mean treatment differences were also observed between both aclidinium/formoterol 
doses and either aclidinium or formoterol in the changes from baseline in both trough FEV1 and peak 
FEV1, with the exception of the treatment difference between aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg and 
aclidinium in the change from baseline in trough FEV1, which did not reach statistical significance. The 
magnitudes of the treatment differences between aclidinium/formoterol and either placebo or the 
constituent monotherapies in the changes from baseline to Day 14 in both trough FEV1 and peak FEV1 
were comparable for the 400/12 μg and 400/6 μg doses.

study LAC-MD-27 (ITT population) 
Both aclidinium/formoterol doses clearly demonstrated statistical superiority over placebo and also 
demonstrated statistical superiority over aclidinium and formoterol monotherapies. While the 
bronchodilation associated with aclidinium/formoterol was generally comparable for the 400/12 μg and 
400/6 μg doses, a pre-specified sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint provided some 
indication of increased efficacy with the 400/12 μg dose. Treatment with aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg 
and aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg was also associated with statistically significant reductions compared 
to placebo in use of rescue medication and improvements in COPD symptoms. 
Study M/40464/26 
An efficacy and safety study of two fixed combinations of aclidinium/formoterol (200/12 μg 
and 200/6 μg) compared with aclidinium monotherapy (200 μg), formoterol monotherapy 
(12 μg) and placebo, all administered BID, in patients with stable, moderate to severe chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease. 
This Phase IIb, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled, 4-period 
incomplete cross-over study was conducted at 28 centres in Europe. Study design was identical to study 
LAC-MD-27. The following treatments (all administered BID via Genuair®) were evaluated: 
aclidinium/formoterol 200/12 μg, aclidinium/formoterol 200/6 μg, aclidinium 200 μg, formoterol 12 μg 
and placebo. 
Efficacy measures and safety and tolerability assessments were the same as those described for study 
LAC-MD-27. 
Of 135 randomised patients, 119 patients (88.1%) completed the study. All randomised patients were 
evaluated for safety and efficacy (ITT population). 
Statistically significant adjusted mean treatment differences were observed between all active treatments 
and placebo in the change from baseline to Day 14 in FEV1 AUC0-12/12h.

showed broadly similar results to the primary analysis.  
Changes from baseline to Day 14 in trough FEV1 were statistically significantly greater with all active 
treatments compared to placebo. Aclidinium/formoterol 200/12 μg and 200/6 μg failed to demonstrate 
statistical superiority over the monotherapies, aclidinium 200 μg and formoterol 12 μg.  
Adjusted mean treatment differences between all active treatments and placebo in the changes from 
baseline in peak FEV1 were statistically significant. Aclidinium/formoterol 200/12 μg and 200/6 μg also 
demonstrated statistical superiority over the monotherapies, aclidinium 200 μg and formoterol 12 μg. 
The magnitudes of the treatment differences between aclidinium/formoterol and either placebo or the

Study M/273FO/23 
Initial clinical studies of aclidinium/formoterol investigated an OD dosing regimen because concurrent 
clinical studies of aclidinium monotherapy were investigating it as an OD treatment. The dose regimen for 
aclidinium/formoterol was switched from OD to BID when results from clinical studies of aclidinium 
monotherapy indicated that the bronchodilator efficacy of aclidinium 200 μg OD was suboptimal and that 
a higher daily dose and a more frequent dose regimen were needed. 
The overall objectives of study M/273FO/23 were to investigate the efficacy and safety of three doses of 
aclidinium/formoterol OD (200/18 μg, 200/12 μg and 200/6 μg) compared to placebo and constituent 
monotherapies, and to determine the optimal formoterol dose to be combined with aclidinium 200 μg in 
subsequent clinical trials. 
This Phase IIb randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled, parallel-group 
study was conducted at 81 centres across Europe, Australia, New Zealand, India, Malaysia and Taiwan. 
Eligible patients were randomised in a ratio of 2:2:2:1:1:1 to one of the following 6 treatments according 
to the randomisation scheme: aclidinium/formoterol 200/18 μg, aclidinium/formoterol 200/12 μg, 
aclidinium/formoterol 200/6 μg, aclidinium 200 μg, formoterol 12 μg or placebo, all administered OD via 
Genuair® for up to 4 weeks. The final follow-up assessment was performed 7 days after the last dose of 
IMP. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to the end of Week 4 in FEV1 AUC0-12/12h. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Changes from baseline to the end of Week 4 in trough FEV1, peak FEV1, FEV1 AUC0-3/3h and 
FEV1 AUC0-6/6h. 
Safety and tolerability were evaluated by recording of AEs, clinical laboratory measures, physical 
examinations including assessment of blood pressure and 12-lead ECGs (including Holter monitoring at a 
subset of sites).  
566 patients were randomised of which 534 patients completed the study.

Aclidinium/formoterol 200/18 μg OD, 200/12 μg OD and 200/6 μg OD were all associated with significant 
bronchodilation relative to placebo in patients with moderate or severe COPD. The magnitudes of the 
improvements from baseline in lung function observed with the 200/18 μg and 200/12 μg doses were 
generally comparable and greater than those observed with the 200/6 μg dose. Aclidinium/formoterol 
200/18 μg and 200/12 μg were associated with statistically superior bronchodilation relative to the 
constituent monotherapies, while the bronchodilatory effects of aclidinium/formoterol 200/6 μg relative 
to the monotherapies were less consistent.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31 
The clinical efficacy programme for aclidinium/formoterol comprised two Phase III pivotal studies 
(M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31) and two Phase III long-term safety studies (LAC-MD-36 and LAC-MD-32). 
The primary objective of the Phase III pivotal studies was to confirm the bronchodilator efficacy of 
aclidinium/formoterol. Both pivotal studies also evaluated the efficacy of aclidinium/formoterol with 
regard to COPD symptoms, disease-specific health status and COPD exacerbations. 
Methods 
Both Phase III pivotal studies (M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31) were multi-centre, randomised, 
double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active comparator-controlled studies of aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 μg and 400/6 μg in patients with moderate or severe stable airflow limitation (post-bronchodilator 
FEV1 ≥ 30% predicted and <80% predicted). The chosen comparators are in accordance with CHMP 
guidelines and are accepted. 
Study M/40464/30 was conducted in Europe, South Africa and South Korea and study LAC-MD-31 was 
conducted in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. 
The treatment duration of both Phase III pivotal studies (24 weeks) was in accordance with the CHMP 
“Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of COPD” (CHMP/483572/2012) 
which states that effects on lung function parameters and symptoms may be demonstrated in 12 to 24 
Assessment report

Page 56/136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
weeks. It is unlikely that a 24-week study will be long enough to demonstrate a clinically meaningful 
effect on exacerbations. 
Both clinical studies included a placebo comparator and active comparators (formoterol monotherapy 
administered via Genuair and aclidinium monotherapy also administered via Genuair). Inclusion of a 
placebo comparator and an active comparator in the Phase III pivotal studies was consistent with the 
CHMP “Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of COPD” 
(CHMP/483572/2012). The choice of comparators was also determined by the CHMP “Guideline on clinical 
development of fixed combination medicinal products” (CHMP/EWP/240/95 Rev. 1) which states that, if 
feasible, inclusion of a placebo group is recommended in confirmatory studies, and also that confirmatory 
studies should preferably compare the fixed combination to the individual components to allow the 
superiority of the combination over the constituent monotherapies to be demonstrated. 
In accordance with CHMP/483572/2012, randomisation of patients to treatment group was stratified by 
smoking status at the time of screening in order to balance treatment groups for smoking status. 
Study Participants  
Patient eligibility criteria for the two Phase III pivotal studies were the same. Principal characteristics of 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the Phase III pivotal studies were as follows: 
•  Patients were aged greater than or equal to 40 years. 
•  Patients had a clinical diagnosis of stable moderate or severe COPD, with COPD severity defined 
on the basis of airflow limitation as per the GOLD Global Strategy (2010). Eligible patients must 
have had a post-bronchodilator FEV1 less than 80% predicted and greater than or equal to 30% 
of predicted, and an FEV1/ FVC of less than 70%. 
•  Patients were current or ex-smokers, with a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years. 
•  Patients had not experienced a respiratory tract infection or COPD exacerbation in the 6 weeks (or 
3 months if hospitalisation for COPD exacerbation was required) prior to screening. 
•  Patients in whom the use of anticholinergic drugs is contraindicated were excluded, i.e. those with 
a history of acute urinary retention or with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy, bladder 
neck obstruction or narrow-angle glaucoma. 
•  Patients had no clinically significant relevant cardiac and respiratory conditions (except COPD) 
and did not have a history or current diagnosis of asthma. 
Although FEV1 reversibility was determined in the Phase III pivotal studies, a predefined entry criterion of 
degree of FEV1 reversibility was not included as bronchodilator reversibility testing is no longer 
recommended by GOLD for the initial diagnosis of COPD or for its differential diagnosis from asthma. 
Furthermore, inclusion of patients with all degrees of FEV1 reversibility in the Phase III clinical studies is 
consistent with the target population for aclidinium/formoterol. 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria used in these studies are accepted by the CHMP. The diagnosis of COPD 
with persistent airway limitation and appropriate smoking history is sufficient to avoid inclusion of 
patients with asthma rather than COPD. Many patients with COPD have some degree of reversibility so it 
is accepted that reversibility no longer constitutes an exclusion criterion. 
Treatments 
The treatments were the same in both pivotal studies: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 57/136 
 
 
 
 
 
Following a 2 to 3-week run-in period during which the stability of the patients’ COPD was confirmed, 
eligible patients were randomised, in a 1:1:1:1:1 (LAC-MD-31) and 2:2:2:2:1 (M/40464/30) ratio to 
receive either aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg, aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg, aclidinium 400 μg, 
formoterol 12 μg or placebo, BID, for up to 24 weeks (all administered via Genuair®). The final follow-up 
contact was 2 weeks after the last dose of study treatment. 
The qualitative composition of aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate inhalation powder was 
unchanged during the clinical development programme and the final to-be-marketed inhaler version was 
used in Phase III studies (M/40464/30, LAC-MD-31, LAC-MD-32, LAC-MD-36). Moreover, the inhaler 
version used in Phase IIb BID studies (M/40464/26 and LAC-MD-27) was the same as the to-be-marketed 
inhaler except for the difference in counter ring (30 actuations instead of 60 actuations), which does not 
have any impact on the aerodynamic performance of the inhaler. 
Table 12: Overview of versions of the Almirall inhaler and their use in clinical studies of 
aclidinium/formoterol 
The most important components of the Almirall inhaler that determine the dispersion and 
deagglomeration of the inhalation powder were unaltered between the inhaler versions used during the 
development of aclidinium/formoterol. The modification of the counter ring of SD2FL(MC) is not expected 
to influence the pharmaceutical performance characteristics because the counter ring is not involved in 
the dispersion or deagglomeration of the inhalation powder. 
Objectives 
The  objectives  of  studies  M/40464/30  and  LAC-MD-31  were  to  assess  the  long-term  bronchodilator 
efficacy  of  two  fixed  combinations  of  inhaled  aclidinium/formoterol  BID  (400/12  μg  and  400/6  μg) 
compared  with  the  monocomponents  and  placebo  as  well  as  to  assess  the  benefits  of 
aclidinium/formoterol  in  terms  of  symptoms  of  COPD,  disease-related  health  status  and  COPD 
exacerbations, and to evaluate safety and tolerability. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The objectives and endpoints were the same in both studies. 
A 12-hour serial spirometry sub-study was performed for a subgroup of 20% of patients at selected study 
centres. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Change from baseline to Week 24 in FEV1 at 1 hour post-dose (primary comparison: each 
aclidinium/formoterol fixed combination vs. aclidinium 400 μg). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 58/136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Change from baseline to Week 24 in morning pre-dose (trough) FEV1 (primary comparison: each 
aclidinium/formoterol fixed combination vs. formoterol 12 μg). 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
• 
Improvement in TDI focal score at Week 24 (primary comparison: each aclidinium/formoterol 
fixed combination vs. placebo). 
•  Change from baseline in SGRQ total score at Week 24 (primary comparison: each 
aclidinium/formoterol fixed combination vs. placebo). 
Notable additional efficacy variables were: 
•  Changes from baseline by time point (visit) in FEV1 at 1 hour post-dose, peak FEV1, trough FEV1, 
trough FVC and trough IC. 
•  Changes from baseline in FEV1 and FVC in the 3 h post-dose on Day 1 and Week 24 and changes 
from baseline to Day 1 and Week 24 in FEV1 AUC0-3/3h and FVC AUC0-3/3h, respectively. 
•  Change from baseline in FEV1 at 5 minutes post-dose on Day 1 and the number (%) of patients 
who achieved onset of bronchodilation (defined as >15% increase from baseline in FEV1) by 5 
minutes post-dose on Day 1. 
•  Changes from baseline in FEV1 in the 12 h post-dose on Day 1 and Week 24 (data from 12-hour 
serial spirometry sub-study). 
•  Changes from baseline by visit in the TDI Focal score and SGRQ Total score. 
•  Percentages of patients with clinically significant improvements in TDI focal score and SGRQ total 
score at Week 24. 
•  Exacerbation rate (number of exacerbations per patient per year), numbers (%) of patients with 
at least one COPD exacerbation and time to first COPD exacerbation, defined on the basis of both 
HRU and EXACT. 
•  Change from baseline in the daily use of rescue medication. 
•  Change from baseline in COPD symptoms assessed using E-RS. 
•  Change from baseline in night-time and early morning COPD symptoms. 
Safety and tolerability were evaluated by recording of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory 
assessments, vital signs (blood pressure) and 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs; including 24-hour 
Holter monitoring at subset of sites). 
Sample size 
Study M/40464/30 
In total 2443 patients were screened, of whom, 1729 patients were considered eligible and were 
randomised. In total, 714 (29.2%) patients were considered screen failures, the main reason being 
non-fulfilment of inclusion/exclusion criteria (88.9%). 
Most patients completed study treatment (88.3%); a slightly lower percentage of patients in the placebo 
group completed study treatment (82.5%) compared with the active treatment groups (87.0% to 
91.2%). Patients’ personal request was the most frequent reason given for discontinuation (4.2%), 
followed by AE (other than COPD exacerbation) (2.9%), and protocol non-compliance (2.0%). In general, 
the reasons for discontinuation reported were for a low and similar percentage of patients across the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 59/136 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment groups. However, the percentage of patients who discontinued due to patients’ personal 
request and lack of efficacy was numerically higher in patients receiving placebo (7.2% and 3.1%, 
respectively) than in the other groups (range for patients’ personal request: 2.6% to 4.9%; range for lack 
of efficacy: 0% to 1.3%). 
Study LAC-MD-31 
A total of 370 (21.9%) of all randomized patients were discontinued from the study. Overall, the placebo 
treatment group had the highest incidence of discontinuation (30.0%) and FDC 400/6 μg had the lowest 
incidence (18.3%). The overall incidence of discontinuation in the FDC 400/12 μg, aclidinium 400 μg, and 
formoterol 12 μg was 19.5%, 21.2%, and 20.4%, respectively. The most frequently reported reasons for 
discontinuation were AE (5.6%), withdrawal of consent (4.7%), and protocol violation (4.4%). 
The percentage of patients who discontinued due to AEs was comparable between the FDC (6.2% and 
6.5% for FDC 400/12 μg and FDC 400/6 μg, respectively) and placebo treatment groups (6.2%), and 
slightly higher than the aclidinium 400 μg (4.7%) and formoterol 12 μg (4.1%) treatment groups. 
Discontinuation due to insufficient response occurred most often in the placebo treatment group (5.9%), 
and least often in the FDC treatment groups (1.5% and 1.2% for FDC 400/12 μg and FDC 400/6 μg, 
respectively). Comparatively, 2.4% and 2.9% of patients in the aclidinium 400 μg and formoterol 12 μg 
treatment groups, respectively, discontinued due to insufficient response. Patients treated with placebo 
were most likely to discontinue due to COPD exacerbation (2.4%) as compared to patients treated with 
the FDCs (2.1% and 0.9% for FDC 400/12 μg and FDC 400/6 μg, respectively), aclidinium 400 μg (2.1%), 
or formoterol 12 μg (1.5%). 
Randomisation 
A centralised IVRS was used. IVRS stratified randomisation by each patient’s smoking status at the time 
of screening (smoker or ex-smoker) in order to balance treatment groups regarding smoking status. As 
this was a double-blind study, neither the patient nor the research staff knew the treatment assigned to 
each patient. 
Study centre staff obtained kit numbers from the IVRS at each visit when study medication was to be 
dispensed. Randomisation data were strictly confidential, accessible only to authorised staff, until the 
time of unblinding of the allocated treatment of all study patients after hard lock of the database upon 
completion of the study. Only when the study was completed and the data verified and locked were the 
randomisation codes made available for data analysis.  
In order to assign a treatment to each randomisation number, a computer generated randomisation 
schedule was prepared by the Statistics Programming Group within Almirall before initiation of the study 
according to the relevant Almirall Standard Operating Procedure. The block size was determined in 
agreement with the Clinical Trial Manager and was not communicated to the Investigators. 
A table presenting the randomisation codes, patient identification number, and treatment assignments is 
presented by study centre. 
Blinding (masking) 
Inhalers and medication kits containing study medication were of the same external appearance ensuring 
the double-blind of the study. Active ingredients had no perceptible taste, appearance, odour or colour 
that could unmask the blinded design. The blind was not broken except in medical emergencies, as 
assessed by the Investigator, when the maintenance of the patient’s safety required knowledge of the 
study medication administered.

Statistical methods 
Table 13: Pre-specified sequence of testing for multiplicity adjustment for Phase III pivotal 
studies: M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31 
Both co-primary efficacy variables were analysed by means of a MMRM. The dependent variable was the 
change from baseline to each scheduled post baseline visit during the treatment period until Week 24. The 
model was adjusted for pre- and post-bronchodilator (salbutamol) FEV1 at screening, age, and baseline 
FEV1 as covariates, and treatment group, gender, smoking status, visit, and treatment group-by-visit 
interaction as fixed effect factors. 
The within-patient correlation was modelled using the unstructured covariance matrix. If the model did 
not converge, then the compound symmetry covariance structure was used. Restricted maximum 
likelihood method was used. 
Each treatment effect and treatment differences were estimated by the least squares (LS) Means on the 
corresponding treatment-by-visit interaction at Week 24, along with their standard errors (SEs) and 95% 
CIs, and the p-value corresponding to the between-treatment group difference. 
The pre-specified sequence of analysing the endpoints and treatment comparison is given in the table 
above. This was agreed with the FDA to facilitate labelling claims.  
A sensitivity analysis using a pattern-mixture model based on non-future dependent missing value 
restrictions was performed to assess the robustness of the primary MMRM results to the possible violation 
of the missing-at-random assumption. 
The pre-specified hierarchical testing procedure is not directly relevant to this submission as an effect on 
lung function and symptoms needs to be demonstrated to obtain a licence in the EU. Therefore, this 
assessment does not include further details of the testing strategy.   
As noted in the assessment of the previous studies the use of MMRM does not necessarily produce an 
appropriate estimate of the treatment effect. The sensitivity analysis using a pattern-mixture model may 
be a more appropriate summary of the results of these studies.

Conduct of the study 
The protocol amendments were minor updates and corrections that would not have affected the overall 
clinical outcomes of the studies. 
Study M/40464/30 
There were two global amendments to this study protocol: 
Global amendment #1 (May 2012) 
•  Clarifications to the text, administrative and typographical errors. 
• 
For the purposes of this clinical trial, Cenduit, the company providing the Interactive Voice 
Response System (IVRS) service, also made available an Interactive Web Response System 
(IWRS). In order to avoid replacing “IVRS” by “IVRS and/or IWRS” throughout the whole protocol 
document, a clarification note is added only in section 5.3 “Participating Companies”. 
•  To correct the following inconsistency: There is an error in section 10.10.1 when requiring 
salbutamol to be stable at least 4 weeks before Screening. According to section 10.10.2, 
salbutamol is used as relief medication during the trial, and as such (and as a matter of fact), 
salbutamol must be dispensed to all patients of the study at the time of Informed Consent 
signature and be used by them on as needed basis at any time, regardless patient used it before 
study start or not.  
•  To amend the following inconsistency and clarify protocol requirements: Oral sustained release 
xanthines are permitted during the study if stable for at least 4 weeks before Screening Visits, 
whilst non-oral sustained release forms must be stopped 72 hours before Screening Visit. 
However, there is an administrative error in the protocol when giving the example of 
aminophylline as prohibited xanthine, because in fact there is an oral sustained release form of 
aminophylline available on the market.  
•  Protocol allows certain time windows for the different Visits of the study (section 11). However, 
certain situations cannot be anticipated nor detailed in the study protocol (e.g. technical device 
not working at the time of the visit appointment, patient intake of IMP morning dose before the 
visit, long holiday period, etc). In some situations, the time windows specified in the protocol do 
not allow re-scheduling the visit on a later date and induce sites to skip a patient´s visit. Still, the 
risk of not checking patient status and skip a visit should be balanced. Therefore a comment is 
added in the protocol so that sites know how they can seek advice in exceptional situations.  
•  According to the current protocol wording, there is a ± 30 minutes deviation allowance for the 
spirometry to be performed at 5 minutes post-morning IMP dose. This is an administrative error, 
since 30 minutes before would mean pre-IMP dose and at 30 min post dose there is another 
spirometry scheduled. No deviation allowance was anticipated for the “5 min post-morning IMP 
dose” time point. Protocol is amended accordingly. 
•  Study assessments at Visit 1 should be grouped as assessments pre-randomisation or 
post-randomisation. However BDI, SGRQ and EQ-5D at Visit 1 are described to occur after IVRS 
randomisation call and before first study drug dosing. This error was proactively fixed in the EDC 
design so that these tests are performed (and captured), as the remaining baseline assessments, 
before randomisation call. 
•  The Flow Chart of Trial Assessments (section 11.2 page 37) clearly differentiates footnote # 7 for 
Post-dose PFTs on Visit 1 and footnote # 8 for Post-dose PFT on Visits 2, 3 and 6. Difference 
consists on PFT at 5 minutes post-dose, which is only to be performed at Visit 1. However, due to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 64/136 
 
 
 
 
 
administrative error, the PFT at 5 minutes post-dose appears on the list of assessments described 
on each specific protocol Visit section, from where it is now deleted. The spirometer software was 
correctly programmed according to the Flow Chart during the trial set-up phase, and therefore 
the PFT at 5 minutes post-dose is only being captured at Visit 1. 
•  To avoid the use of spirometry manual records. 
•  To specify the repeatability criteria applied to Inspiratory Capacity measurement provided this is 
not covered by ATS/ERS guidelines. 
•  Depending on each site internal organisation, site personnel may not have access to the room or 
to the computer where the EDC data is to be recorded at the time of patient’ visit (room or 
computer busy, limited internet access etc). Therefore not always the Health Resources 
Utilisation Questionnaire form of the EDC can be used as data source. Medical notes or 
worksheets may be used instead as source document instead. 
Global amendment #2 (October 2012) 
•  Due to the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in patients with COPD, Major Adverse Cardiac 
Events will be evaluated by a committee composed of independent cardiologists. 
•  The CRO provides 24 hour medical cover for emergency situation to research staff ONLY. 
Research staff are responsible for covering study patients emergency calls 24 hours throughout 
the study. 
•  To update some Additional Variables and its planned analysis. 
•  A new population set is defined for the analysis of COPD exacerbation outcomes. This population 
set coincides with the Safety Population definition, however it is categorised as a different set 
because its scope is the analysis of efficacy outcomes. 
•  The multiplicity statistical approach has been updated following the CHMP scientific advice. 
Sample size remains unchanged, but the wording has been updated. The hierarchy for the US 
region is removed from the final protocol as it is under discussion with the FDA. It will be specified 
in detail in the final protocol for study LAC-MD-31, which will be signed off before the unblinding 
of the both studies M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31. 
•  SAS version to be updated in the SAP. 
•  The sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the MMRM model is updated. 
There were also several local amendments specific to individual countries, which would not have affected 
the overall clinical results. 
Study LAC-MD-31 
There were four protocol amendments in study LAC-MD-31:  
The purpose of Amendment #1(23 Aug 2011) was to: 
•  Provide study-specific instructions on proper rescue medication inhaler use and restrictions 
before visits according to revised ATS/ERS criteria (Miller et al, 2005) 
•  Correct the co-primary and secondary efficacy assessments 
•  Provide clarification of the clinical laboratory determinations 
•  Correct the statistical efficacy parameters 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 65/136 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Clarify and correct information throughout the protocol, as necessary. 
The purpose of Amendment #2 (14 Feb 2012) was to: 
•  Define the Registration Visit (Visit 0) and Screening Visit (Visit 1) 
•  Clarify method to assess compliance, redefine inadequate compliance, and provide guidance to  
the study centre as to when the Sponsor should be notified in cases of noncompliance 
•  Clarify and define inadequate electronic diary compliance 
•  Add information regarding the extension study LAC-MD-36 at the end of Visit 7 
•  Revise the statistical analyses of the HEOR parameters 
•  Amend elements of informed consent section to align with 21 CFR, Parts 50 and 312, revised 01 
Apr 2011 
•  Clarify concomitant medication restrictions and known drug interaction effects of aclidinium 
bromide and formoterol fumarate 
•  Clarify and correct information throughout the protocol as necessary 
The purpose of Amendment #3 (07 Jan 2013) was to: 
•  Describe the adjudication of MACE activities 
•  Add requirement of additional follow-up for COPD exacerbations in patients who prematurely 
discontinue 
•  Update the regulatory status of aclidinium bromide 
•  Clarify electronic diary and TrialSlate procedures for patients participating in the extension study, 
LAC-MD-36, at the end of Visit 7/ET 
•  Update statistical analyses sections to add the ITT-Exacerbations patient population, redefine 
multiplicity adjustments, and add additional efficacy parameters, along with other clarifications 
throughout the sections 
•  Clarify health outcomes analyses 
•  Update contact information for FRI personnel 
The purpose of Amendment #4 (20 Mar 2013) was to: 
•  Add the requirement for a comparison of aclidinium 400 μg versus placebo for the US filing only 
to the secondary efficacy parameter of change from baseline in SGRQ total score at Week 24 
•  Define the different multiplicity strategies to be used in the EU filing and the US filing in response 
to comments from the FDA and to be consistent with changes made in SAP amendment #1 
Baseline data 
Numbers analysed 
The definitions of the analysis populations are in accordance with those stated in the study protocols and 
are accepted as appropriate.

Analysis populations 
A Blind Data Review Meeting (BDRM) was convened to assign, in a blinded manner before breaking the 
randomization codes, the patients that participated in the clinical trials to the analysis population sets 
previously defined in the study protocols and in the Statistical Analysis Plans (SAP). 
SCREENED POPULATION 
The Screened Population is defined as all patients who attended Screening Visit and received a patient 
number. 
RANDOMIZED POPULATION 
The Randomized Population is defined as all patients in the Screened Population who were randomized to 
a treatment group in the study. 
SAFETY POPULATION 
The Safety Population is defined as all randomised patients who took at least one dose of Investigational 
Medicinal Product (IMP). 
INTENT-TO-TREAT POPULATION 
The Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT) for all efficacy endpoints other than Exacerbation efficacy endpoints 
is defined as all randomised patients who took at least one dose of IMP and have a baseline and at least 
one post-baseline FEV1 assessment. 
PER-PROTOCOL POPULATION 
The Per-Protocol Population (PP) is defined as a subset of ITT population constituted by those patients 
who: (a) met all inclusion/exclusion criteria liable to affect the efficacy assessment, (b) attained a 
sufficient compliance to the treatment received, (c) did not present serious deviations of the protocol that 
may affect efficacy. 
INTENT-TO-TREAT EXACERBATIONS POPULATION 
The Intent-to-Treat population for Exacerbations efficacy endpoints (ITT-E) is defined as all randomised 
patients who took at least one dose of IMP. 
Study M/40464/30 
Table 18: 
All randomised patients received at least one dose of study medication and were included in the Safety 
and ITT-Exacerbation populations (100.0%). Three randomised patients were excluded from the ITT

population (1726/1729 [99.8%]) due to missing baseline or post-baseline FEV1 data and a further 93 
patients were excluded from the PP population (1633/1729 [94.4%]) due to deviations that could have 
had a serious impact on the primary efficacy analysis. 
Study LAC-MD-31 
Table 19: 
Approximately 10% of all patients in the ITT Population were identified as either having protocol 
deviations that led to exclusion from the PP Population or were deemed not appropriate for inclusion in the 
PP Population. Less than half of these patients were discontinued from treatment due to protocol 
deviations. Patients taking < 75% of assigned investigational product and patients with end date of COPD 
exacerbation < 2 weeks (mild) or < 4 weeks (moderate/severe) before scheduled Visit 7 accounted for 
the majority of patients who were excluded from the PP Population. Other reasons for exclusion from the 
PP Population for which there were reports of ≥  2 patients in any individual treatment group were (1) 
patients who took > 110% of assigned investigational product, (2) patients enrolled at 2 investigative 
sites, and (3) patients receiving unstable oral or parental corticosteroids dose 2 weeks prior to Visits 2 or 
7. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The outcomes are elaborated in the next section. 
Ancillary analyses 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints (changes from baseline in FEV1 at 1 hour post-dose and in trough 
FEV1) and secondary efficacy endpoints (changes from baseline in TDI focal score and SGRQ total score) 
were analysed in various subpopulations of the pooled population of M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31. The 
following subpopulations were evaluated:  
-gender (male or female) 
-age group (≥ 65 years or <65 years) 
-body mass index (BMI) group (obese, pre-obese or normal weight/underweight) 
-COPD severity (moderate or severe)

Although analysis of treatment effect by race was planned, the number of non-Caucasians was too low to 
allow for a meaningful analysis (94.1% of the pooled population was Caucasian). 
Statistically significant adjusted mean treatment differences between aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg or 
400/6 μg and placebo in the co-primary endpoints were observed across all subpopulations. The 
magnitudes of the adjusted mean treatment differences (and 95% CIs) were generally similar to those 
observed for the overall ITT population, with the exception of the subpopulations of bronchodilator 
reversibility (both doses) and gender (400/12 μg) for FEV1 at 1 hour post-dose and gender (400/12 μg) 
for trough FEV1, with greater treatment differences observed in reversible patients and in females. The 
observed effect of gender on the bronchodilation endpoints can be attributed, at least in part, to baseline 
differences in FEV1 and the physiological differences in lung function between males and females. 
Statistically significant adjusted mean treatment differences between aclidinium/formoterol (both doses) 
and placebo in the changes from baseline in TDI focal score were observed across all subpopulations; 
results across subpopulations were robust. 
The subpopulation analysis of the SGRQ endpoint was limited by the lack of homogeneity in this endpoint 
between M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31 mainly due to the unexpectedly large placebo response in 
M/40464/30 so that the pooled analysis for the treatment comparisons versus placebo is not reported. 
Forest plots of the results of subgroup analyses have been provided in the Summary of Clinical Efficacy. 
The effect on lung function is consistently greater in males than females though the improvement in TDI 
is similar in both genders. Effects in the <65 year olds is also greater than in the ≥65 year olds but the 
confidence intervals overlap. 
Lung function shows a greater improvement in those patients with moderate COPD compared with those 
with severe COPD but the effect on TDI is greater in the subgroup of patients with severe COPD. 
Not surprisingly there is a greater improvement in lung function parameters in those patients exhibiting 
greater reversibility at the beginning of the study than in those patients whose airways obstruction 
showed less reversibility. However the improvement in TDI was greater for those patients demonstrating 
less reversibility. 
Overall the subgroup analyses demonstrate the generalizability of the results to the greater COPD 
population.  
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The two Phase III pivotal studies were very similar in design and in the efficacy variables assessed, 
therefore, they have been pooled to (i) increase the precision of treatment effect estimates for selected 
clinically relevant efficacy endpoints (ii) assess the effect of each aclidinium/formoterol dose on COPD 
exacerbations (for which the individual studies were not powered to detect a difference) and iii) assess 
consistency of treatment effect in subpopulations. The pooled analysis also allowed estimates of the 
treatment effect of each dose of aclidinium/formoterol compared to component monotherapies on the TDI 
and SGRQ endpoints to be determined. 
It was planned to determine treatment effects for the SGRQ endpoints compared to placebo and 
component monotherapies in the pooled population of Phase III pivotal studies (M/40464/30 and 
LAC-MD-31). However, as a consequence of the lack of homogeneity between M/40464/30 and 
LAC-MD-31 in the treatment differences between aclidinium/formoterol and placebo in the changes from 
baseline to Week 24 in SGRQ total score, the comparisons to placebo for SGRQ endpoints in the pooled 
population of M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31 have not been reported. The lack of homogeneity between

studies is primarily due to an unexpectedly large placebo response in M/40464/30 compared to that 
observed in LAC-MD-31. 
Results and analyses of the following 2 secondary efficacy parameters for the US filing are also provided 
in the Integrated Summary of Efficacy: 
•  Reduction in rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbation per patient per year in each dose of 
FDC relative to placebo based on pooled data from M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31 
•  Reduction in rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbation per patient per year due to the effect 
of aclidinium 400 μg relative to placebo based on pooled data from M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31 
A total of 3394 patients were included in the ITT Populations of M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31 and included 
in the pooled analyses of these studies.

The mean ages of the patient populations in M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31 were similar. In LAC-MD-31 
compared to M/40464/30, a slightly higher proportion of the patients were at least 70 years of age 
(28.1% vs. 22.6%) and a slightly lower proportion of the patients were between 60 and 69 years of age 
(40.7% vs 45.2%). In addition, a lower proportion of males were included in the ITT population of 
LAC-MD-31 compared to M/40464/30 (53.2% vs. 67.6%). Minor differences in the racial profile between 
the two studies were observed which are consistent with conduct of these studies in different 
geographical regions. 
Improvement in lung function 
Lung function (as determined by pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1/percentage predicted FEV1 and 
post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio) at screening was very similar for the two studies. Bronchial 
reversibility to short-acting β2-agonists (SABAs) was higher in LAC-MD-31 (percentage and absolute 
reversibility: 17.9% and 0.205 L, respectively) than in M/40464/30 (12.7% and 0.152 L, respectively).

In the pooled population, pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was 1.368 L and FEV1 percentage predicted normal 
was 47.7%; both values are consistent with a patient population with moderate or severe COPD. 
Bronchial reversibility to SABAs was 15.3% (with a mean absolute change of 0.178 L).

The two pivotal studies were identical in design and inclusion/exclusion criteria and the pooling of results 
is accepted. 
The increase over baseline in 1-hour post-dose FEV1 demonstrates a clinically relevant improvement 
compared with placebo and compared with aclidinium alone for the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg dose

but not for the aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg dose. Therefore it is accepted that formoterol 12μg is the 
appropriate strength to be included in the combination. 
In the comparisons of aclidinium/formoterol with formoterol alone, even in the pooled analysis the 
improvement in trough FEV1 over baseline at 68ml does not reach a clinically meaningful level. The 
results regarding improvement in lung function suggest that the aclidinium/formoterol combination does 
not give a clinically significant benefit over formoterol alone. 
Improvement in TDI focal score 
Statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements versus placebo in TDI focal score were 
observed with aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg and 400/6 μg in both M/40464/30 (1.29 units and 1.16 
units, respectively [p<0.0001 for both]) and LAC-MD-31 (1.44 units and 1.40 units, respectively 
[p<0.0001 for both]), as well as in the pooled population from M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31 (1.43 units 
and 1.33 units, respectively [p<0.0001]). 
Trends towards statistically significant greater improvements in TDI focal score at Week 24 with 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg compared with aclidinium or formoterol were observed in both 
M/40464/30 (0.40 units [p=0.084] and 0.45 units [p=0.052], respectively) and LAC-MD-31 (0.46 units 
[p=0.108] and 0.49 units [p=0.084], respectively). 
Analysis of the pooled population of M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31 showed statistically significant greater 
improvements in TDI focal score at Week 24 with the 400/12 μg dose of aclidinium/formoterol compared 
with aclidinium or formoterol (0.44 units [p=0.016] and 0.47 units [p=0.009], respectively) and with the 
400/6 μg dose compared with formoterol (0.37 units [p=0.039]) but the treatment difference between 
the 400/6 μg dose and aclidinium missed statistical significance (0.33 units [p=0.064]).

were statistically significantly higher with aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg and 400/6 μg than with 
placebo in M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31. 
In the pooled population, aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg or 400/6 μg increased the proportions of 
patients with clinically significant improvements in TDI focal score at Week 24 compared to aclidinium 
(61.9% and 63.9% versus 55.7%, respectively and p=0.056 and p=0.007, respectively) and formoterol

Table 29: Proportions of patients with clinically significanta improvements in TDI focal score 
the pooled population of M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31: ITT population 
Both strengths of aclidinium/formoterol reached a clinically meaningful improvement (≥1 unit) over 
baseline in TDI focal score compared with placebo. In the pooled analysis the improvement in TDI of 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg compared with the monocomponents does not reach the 1 unit that is 
considered to be the level that would be meaningful to the patient. However the improvements compared 
with both formoterol and aclidinium alone are similar at 0.47 and 0.44 units respectively. 
Analysis of the proportion of patients who achieved the clinically meaningful improvement in TDI focal 
score of at least 1 unit was also greater (and statistically significant) in the combination groups compared 
with placebo but did not reach statistical significance for the 400/12 μg group compared with the 
individual components. 
Improvement in SGRQ total score 
In LAC-MD-31, statistically significant and clinically meaningful (i.e. of at least 4 units) improvements 
from baseline in SGRQ total score were observed at Week 12 and at Week 24 in all active treatment 
groups. At Week 24 in LAC-MD-31, adjusted mean treatment differences between aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 μg or 400/6 μg and placebo were statistically significant (-4.35 units [p<0.0001] and -3.73 units 
[p<0.001], respectively); with the improvement in SGRQ total score observed with the 400/12 μg dose 
being of a clinically significant magnitude. In M/40464/30, clinically-relevant improvements from baseline 
in SGRQ total score were observed in all active treatment groups, as observed in LAC-MD-31. However, 
an unexpectedly large improvement from baseline to Week 24 in SGRQ total score (-6.51 units) was 
observed in the placebo group of M/40464/30, which was greater in magnitude that those observed in the 
monotherapy groups. Consequently only small adjusted mean treatment differences between 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg or 400/6 μg and placebo were observed (-0.65 units [p=0.598] and 
-1.83 units [p=0.141], respectively).

Due to the large and unexpected placebo effect on SGRQ in Study M/40464/30 the pooled analysis of this 
endpoint does not add any helpful information regarding the efficacy of aclidinium/formoterol on the 
symptoms of COPD. In Study LAC-MD-31 a clinically meaningful improvement in SGRQ compared with 
placebo was demonstrated but the improvement compared with the individual components was small and 
its clinical relevance is hard to assess.

Exacerbations 
Exacerbations were defined according to healthcare resource utilisation and worsening of COPD 
symptoms for at least two consecutive days using a definition (hereafter referred to as the healthcare 
resource utilisation [HRU] definition) similar to that used in other COPD trials. Exacerbations were also 
assessed according to the Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT) daily 
diary. The EXACT was developed and validated to standardise methodology for assessing the frequency, 
severity and duration of exacerbations in COPD. 
Rates (per patient/year) of moderate or severe exacerbations or of exacerbations of any severity (mild, 
moderate or severe), as defined by HRU, were higher in LAC-MD-31 than in M/40464/30. Considerably 
higher exacerbation rates were observed in both pivotal studies when exacerbations were defined 
according to EXACT compared to when exacerbations were defined according to HRU. In general, 
exacerbation rates were also higher in LAC-MD-31 than in M/40464/30 when exacerbations were defined 
according to EXACT. 
In the individual Phase III pivotal studies, aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg and 400/6 μg were associated 
with numerical reductions compared to placebo in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations (HRU 
definition) and in the rates of any exacerbations (HRU or EXACT definitions). These numerical reductions 
in exacerbation rate reached statistical significance only for the comparison of the 400/12 μg dose and 
placebo in the rate of EXACT exacerbations in M/40464/30. 
In the pooled population, rates of moderate or severe exacerbations (defined by HRU) were lower for 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg and 400/6 μg (0.29 per patient/year and 0.33 per patient/year) than for 
placebo (0.42 per patient/year). A similar pattern was observed for the rates of any exacerbation (defined 
by HRU or EXACT). Aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg was associated with statistically significant 
reductions compared to placebo in the rates of moderate or severe exacerbations (by 29%; RR 0.71 
[p=0.036]) and exacerbations according to EXACT (by 22%; RR 0.78 [p=0.010]). A reduction in the rate 
of exacerbations of any severity (defined by HRU) was also observed with aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 
μg which just missed statistical significance (RR 0.76 [p=0.079]). Aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg was 
associated only with numerical reductions in exacerbation rates compared to placebo. 
Exacerbation rates (HRU or EXACT) were generally numerically lower with aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 
μg than with either aclidinium or formoterol monotherapy.

In both pivotal studies, numerical reductions were observed with aclidinium/formoterol compared to 
placebo in HRs for the time to the first moderate or severe exacerbation (HRU definition) or in the time to 
the first exacerbation of any severity (HRU and EXACT definitions). Analysis of the pooled population 
showed that aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg statistically significantly reduced the HR for the time to a 
first moderate or severe exacerbation (by 30%; HR 0.70 [p=0.027]) and for the time to any exacerbation 
(as defined by both HRU [by 28%; HR 0.72 (p=0.030)] and EXACT [by 21%; HR 0.79 [p=0.014]) and 
thus delayed the time to first COPD exacerbation. 
Reductions in the HRs for the time to first exacerbation (HRU or EXACT) were numerically greater with 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg than with either aclidinium or formoterol monotherapy.

Generally six-month studies are too short to see any meaningful treatment effect on exacerbations in 
COPD. The pooled analysis of these two pivotal Phase III studies increases the likelihood of the studies 
demonstrating some effect. 
In general the rate of exacerbations is higher using the EXACT definition than the HRU definition.  
Using the HRU definition of exacerbations; although the rate ratio for moderate to severe exacerbations 
in the pooled analysis reaches statistical significance when the combination aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 
μg is compared with placebo, the actual difference in exacerbation rate is 0.13 exacerbations per 
patient/year. It is debatable whether this is clinically meaningful.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 81/136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When based on the EXACT definition the difference between aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg and placebo 
in the pooled population rises to 0.33 exacerbations per patient/year so that a patient needs to be treated 
with the combination on average for 3 years to prevent one exacerbation. This could be considered to be 
of clinical relevance given that exacerbations in general hasten the deterioration of the disease in patients 
with COPD. However only a reduction of at least one event over a defined period (usually a year) would 
be perceived as clinically relevant by the patient (Calverley 2005). 
In the analysis of Hazard Ratios (HR) for time to first exacerbation only the effect of aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 μg versus placebo in the pooled population reaches statistical significance. However it is difficult 
to assess the clinical relevance of these results.

Sufficient numbers of patients aged >70 years were included in the two pivotal Phase III studies (22% 
and 28%) to be reassured that efficacy and safety seen in the total population can be extrapolated to that 
age group. 
As COPD is a disease that is not seen in children a class waiver from the European Paediatric Regulation 
(Regulation [EC] Number 1901/2006) has been granted for the condition COPD. 
Supportive studies: Long-Term Safety Studies, LAC-MD-32 and LAC-MD-36 
Although LAC-MD-32 and LAC-MD-36 were designed primarily to assess the long-term safety of 
aclidinium/formoterol BID, some efficacy measures were also evaluated to provide information on the 
long-term efficacy of aclidinium/formoterol BID. 
Study LAC-MD-36 
A long-term extension study of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two 
aclidinium/formoterol fixed combinations (400/12 μg and 400/6 μg) compared with 
aclidinium monotherapy (400 μg), formoterol monotherapy (12 μg) and placebo in patients 
with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
Study LAC-MD-36 was a continuation study for patients in the US and Canada who had completed Phase 
III pivotal study LAC-MD-31 and provided written informed consent to participate in the study. Efficacy 
measures evaluated in LAC-MD-36 were the same as those included in LAC-MD-31. Consistency in the 
collection and review of spirometric data throughout studies LAC-MD-31 and LAC-MD-36 was ensured by 
continued use of the same centralised spirometry company for quality control and spirogram review. 
The demographics and baseline characteristics of the patient population in LAC-MD-36 were consistent 
with those of the lead-in study. 
A summary of the number of patients who dropped out of each treatment arm in study LAC-MD-36 is 
shown below:

Figure 9: 
Missing data for pulmonary assessments, TDI and SGRQ were handled using the direct likelihood 
approach. 
As expected in a 1 year study there was a considerable number of patients who did not complete 52 weeks 
treatment. The analysis provided below uses the direct likelihood approach to impute missing values. This 
approach assumes these values were missing at random.   
Efficacy results 
The improvements from baseline in FEV1 at 1 hour post-dose observed with aclidinium/formoterol 
compared to placebo at Day 4 of dosing were sustained up to Week 52. Over the 52-week treatment 
period, adjusted mean treatment differences between aclidinium/formoterol and placebo ranged from 
0.284 L to 0.299 L for the 400/12 μg dose and from 0.252 L to 0.280 L for the 400/6 μg dose [p<0.0001 
for comparisons of both doses to placebo]). Statistically significant improvements were also observed at 
all time points up to Week 52 with both doses of aclidinium/formoterol relative to formoterol or aclidinium 
monotherapies. At all time points up to and including Week 52, numerically greater increases from 
baseline were observed with the 400/12 μg dose of aclidinium/formoterol compared to the 400/6 μg dose.

Figure 10: LS mean changes from baseline in FEV1 at 1 hour post-dose (L) by visit over 52 
weeks, studies LAC-MD-31 and LAC-MD-36 (Combined ITT population) 
Both doses of aclidinium/formoterol were associated with clinically significant improvements from 
baseline in trough FEV1 which were maintained for the duration of the 52-week treatment period. 
Adjusted mean treatment differences between aclidinium/formoterol and placebo ranged from 0.118 L to 
0.152 L for the 400/12 μg dose and from 0.107 L to 0.145 L for the 400/6 μg dose (p<0.0001 for all 
comparisons to placebo). Numerical increases from baseline in trough FEV1 compared to formoterol or 
aclidinium were observed with aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg at all visits up to Week 52 and with 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg at most visits up to Week 52. Numerically greater increases from baseline 
in trough FEV1 were also observed with the 400/12 μg dose compared to the 400/6 μg dose.

Clinically and statistically significant improvements in dyspnoea status (TDI focal score) with 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg compared to placebo were maintained from Week 4 to Week 52 
(adjusted mean treatment differences from 1.07 units to 1.49 units [p<0.005 for all comparisons]). 
Statistically significant improvements in TDI focal score with aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg compared to 
placebo were observed at all visits from Week 4 to Week 52 and were of a clinically significant magnitude 
at most visits (adjusted mean treatment differences from 0.83 units to 1.49 units [p<0.01 for all 
comparisons]). Improvements in TDI focal score were numerically greater with aclidinium/formoterol 
(both doses) than with either constituent monotherapy at all visits up to Week 52 and were numerically 
greater with the 400/12 μg dose than the 400/6 μg dose at most visits. 
Figure 12: Improvement in TDI focal score by visit over 52 weeks, studies LAC-MD-31 and 
LAC-MD-36 (Combined ITT population) 
Compared to placebo, statistically significant improvements in SGRQ total score with 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg were maintained from Week 12 to Week 38 and with 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg were maintained from Week 4 to Week 52. Over the 52-week treatment 
period, adjusted mean treatment differences between the 400/12 μg dose and placebo in the changes 
from baseline in SGRQ total score ranged from -1.19 units to -4.35 units and between the 400/6 μg dose 
and placebo ranged from -2.72 units to -4.29 units. 
Over the 52 weeks rates of moderate or severe exacerbations (HRU definition) were lower in the 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg arm (0.39 per patient/year) than in the placebo arm (0.49 per 
patient/year) or aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg arm (0.46 per patient/year) while rates of exacerbations 
of any severity (HRU definition) were similar in the 400/12 μg, 400/6 μg and placebo arms (0.49, 0.50 
and 0.53 per patient/year, respectively). Consequently, aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg was associated 
with a numerical reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations (HRU definition) compared to 
placebo (by 20%; RR 0.80; p=0.186) but did not reduce the rate of exacerbations of any severity (HRU 
definition) compared to placebo (RR 0.92, p=0.586).  
Rates of exacerbation were higher when exacerbations were assessed according to EXACT compared to 
when assessed by HRU and were lower with aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg (1.25 per patient/year) than 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 92/136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with placebo (1.57 per patient/year) or aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg (1.54 per patient/year). A 
numerical reduction (of 20%) in EXACT exacerbation rate was observed with aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 μg compared to placebo, which approached statistical significance (RR 0.80, p=0.068). 
The improvement in lung function parameters over placebo appear to be maintained over the 52 weeks of 
the main study plus the extension study LAC-MD-36. A general decline in effect in all treatment groups 
over the 52-week period is seen reflecting the general deterioration in COPD that is seen in all patients.  
Although the separation between the combination products and the individual monocomponents is 
maintained in 1-hour post-dose FEV1 the same separation is not seen in trough FEV1 with little difference 
between active treatments by week 52. The concern is whether the combination of aclidinium and 
formoterol adds a significant benefit over formoterol alone. 
However the combination does appear to demonstrate a persistent effect on TDI score compared with 
placebo and formoterol. 
The reduction in rates of exacerbations with the combination when compared with placebo is small, even 
over 52 weeks and its clinical relevance is questionable. 
LAC-MD-32 
A long-term safety study of aclidinium/formoterol (400/12 μg) compared with formoterol 
monotherapy (12 μg) in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
This Phase III, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted at 135 centres in the United 
States. Following a 2 to 3-week run-in period during which the stability of the patients’ COPD was 
confirmed, eligible patients were randomised, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive either aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 μg BID or formoterol 12 μg BID (both via Genuair®) for up to 52 weeks. The final follow-up 
assessment (by telephone contact) was conducted 4 weeks after the last dose of study treatment. 
A limited evaluation of efficacy was conducted in study LAC-MD-32. Efficacy measures included: pre-dose 
FEV1 (assessed using locally-available spirometers [which met ATS and ERS recommendations for 
accuracy and precision] rather than centrally provided spirometers as in the Phase III pivotal studies), 
night-time and early morning symptoms (assessed as for M/40464/30), COPD exacerbations (assessed 
according to the HRU definition, as described for the Phase III pivotal studies) and use of rescue 
medication.

Figure 13: 
The withdrawn rate in this study is high. Hence the estimate of treatment effect obtained can rely heavily 
on the approach taken to handling missing data; although it is noted that the timing of discontinuation is 
similar in both groups as shown in Figure 10.1-2 below.

All spirometric efficacy parameters were performed by means of a MMRM analysis. The analysis was 
performed based on all post-baseline measurements using only the observed cases without imputation of 
missing values.  
This approach could be biased in favour of the combination group. Sensitivity analyses using a pattern 
mixture model or other suitable analyses should be provided.

52-week treatment period. At each time point from Week 1 to Week 52, the magnitudes of the increases 
from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 observed with aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg were statistically 
significantly greater than those observed with formoterol monotherapy. The adjusted mean treatment 
difference between aclidinium/formoterol and formoterol ranged between 0.048 L and 0.087L and was 
0.082L at Week 52. 
The percentages of patients with at least one exacerbation of any severity (mild, moderate or severe) or 
at least one moderate or severe exacerbation were similar for the aclidinium/formoterol arm (27.3% and 
25.3%, respectively) and for the formoterol arm (29.8% and 27.8%, respectively). The rates of 
exacerbations (per patient/year) were also similar for the aclidinium/formoterol and formoterol arms for 
any exacerbation (0.57/patient/year and 0.54/patient/year, respectively) and for moderate and severe 
exacerbations (0.52/patient/year and 0.49/patient/year, respectively). 
Study LAC-MD-32 gives limited information on the efficacy of aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg compared 
with formoterol alone. The improvements in trough (pre-dose) FEV1 seem to be similar to those seen in 
the pivotal Phase III studies and did not reach an accepted clinically meaningful improvement of 100mls. 
The relevance of the improvement of 82ml seen at 52 weeks is debatable as published studies have 
demonstrated that patients cannot perceive a difference of <100ml (Donohue 2005). Further analyses 
have been provided using alternative models such as pattern mixture models. These were required as the 
drop-out rate in this study was high and hence the analysis provided using only completers could be 
biased in favour of the combination treatment group. The Applicant has provided further analyses in their 
responses including analyses of the long-term safety studies that impute different penalties according to 
reason for withdrawal to give a fuller picture of whether the treatment effect is robust to assumptions 
made about subjects who withdrew from the studies. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
For the dose finding studies, the focus of the dose of aclidinium shifted from 200µg to 400 µg following the 
completion of the programme for the monocomponent aclidinium bromide Genuair. Therefore dose 
response studies were initially conducted with a dose of aclidinium of 200 µg but the main dose response 
study (LAC-MD-27) was conducted with a dose of 400 µg. The population studied in the dose response 
studies were representative of the population in the proposed indication. Reversibility was not used as a 
means of excluding patients with asthma but smoking history of at least 10 pack-years was used in the 
diagnosis of COPD as per current guidelines. 
The two pivotal clinical Phase III studies were designed as placebo and active controlled studies to 
compare the FDC with placebo and with its component parts. 
The chosen co-primary endpoints of 1 hour post-dose and trough FEV1 to explore the contributions of 
formoterol and aclidinium respectively are considered to be appropriate and the key secondary 
symptomatic endpoints of TDI and SGRQ are in line with the CHMP guideline on the investigation of 
medicinal products for the treatment of COPD. 
The studies were conducted in in accordance with the principles and practices of Good Clinical Practice and 
the Declaration of Helsinki. Changes to the protocols were minor and did not affect the overall conclusions 
of the studies.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The two pivotal Phase III studies have given similar results in that both strengths of the combination 
aclidinium/formoterol product have demonstrated an improvement in lung function compared with 
placebo. However the improvement compared with the monocomponents is less consistent. The 400/12 
μg combination has demonstrated a clinically relevant improvement in 1-hour post-dose FEV1 compared 
with aclidinium alone showing the contribution of the formoterol component but compared with 
formoterol alone the improvement in trough FEV1 does not reach a clinically relevant level in either study 
for either strength of the combination (0.085 L [p<0.0001] and 0.053 L [p=0.002], for 400/12 μg and 
400/6 μg respectively in Study M/40464/30 and 0.045L [p=0.0102] and 0.026 [p= 0.1325] respectively 
in Study LAC-MD-31). In the pooled analysis aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg demonstrated an 
improvement in trough FEV1 compared with formoterol alone of 68ml (CI 44-92ml), which is not 
considered to be clinically relevant. 
In general an improvement of 5-10% of baseline would be considered to be clinically important (Cazzola 
2008); however an improvement of 100ml is usually accepted. The baseline pre-dose FEV1 for the patient 
population investigated in the two pivotal studies was 1.3-1.4L so an improvement between 65ml and 
140ml would be expected. However the difference (68ml) seen with aclidinium/formoterol compared with 
formoterol alone is similar to that seen with other recently licensed LABA/LAMA combinations and post 
hoc responder analyses for clinically meaningful effects on FEV1 and symptomatic endpoints provided by 
the Applicant support the conclusion that aclidinium contributes to a clinically significant extent to the 
overall positive effect of the combination aclidinium/formoterol. 
The improvement in FEV1 should be supported by clinically relevant improvement in symptomatic 
endpoints. 
In the symptomatic endpoint TDI score aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 has demonstrated statistically 
significant improvements over the monocomponents aclidinium and formoterol (0.44 units [p=0.016] 
and 0.47 units [p=0.009], respectively) but it is debatable whether this can be considered to be clinically 
relevant as the minimal clinically relevant improvement in TDI score is generally held to be 1 unit. 
To further explore this, the Applicant has provided post hoc responder analyses of the percentages of 
patients achieving a clinically meaningful improvement in symptomatic scores.

Abbreviations: AB/FF=aclidinium/formoterol; FF=formoterol fumarate dihydrate; CI=95% 
confidence interval; OR=odds ratio. 
The percentages of patients in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 µg group of the pooled population who 
reached the MCIDs for TDI focal score (61.9 %) and SGRQ total score (56.6%) were similar to those 
achieved by both recently approved LABA/LAMA combinations (umeclidinium/vilanterol: 58% and 49% 
respectively and indacaterol/glycopyrronium: 68.1% and 63.7%, respectively).  
The results of SGRQ are difficult to interpret owing to a large placebo effect seen in study M/40464/30 
which cannot be explained. In both studies all active treatment arms demonstrated a clinically meaningful 
improvement over baseline in SGRQ total score of >-4units. In study LAC-MD-31 the combination 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg and aclidinium alone also achieved a -4unit improvement compared with 
placebo but in Study M/40464/30 the difference compared with placebo was minimal. 
The effects of aclidinium/formoterol on exacerbations of COPD have been analysed in the pooled patient 
population of the two pivotal Phase III studies, which has shown an improvement in all severities of 
exacerbation based on the EXACT definition to be as much as 0.33 exacerbations per patient/year. This 
could be a clinically relevant improvement as the rate of exacerbations tends to correlate with rate of 
deterioration of COPD. However in the extension study LAC-MD-36, aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg was 
associated with a numerical reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations (HRU definition) 
compared to placebo (by 20%; RR 0.80; p=0.186) but did not reduce the rate of exacerbations of any 
severity (HRU definition) compared to placebo (RR 0.92, p=0.586) after 52 weeks. It is also debatable 
whether the patient would perceive a reduction of 0.33 exacerbations per year as clinically meaningful. A 
reduction of at least one event per year is currently the best estimate of the minimum clinically important 
difference to the patient.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Conclusions on dose response 
As per the analysis presented the two 14-day studies (LAC-MD-27 and M/40464/26) demonstrated a 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in FEV1 AUC0-12/12h  of 
aclidinium/formoterol 200/12 µg, 200/6 µg, 400/12 µg and 400/6 µg compared with placebo with little 
difference between the strengths. In the secondary endpoint of trough FEV1 400/6 µg and 200/6 µg 
demonstrated a slightly greater improvement compared with placebo than the 400/12 µg and 200/12 µg 
strengths.  
In the longer 4-week study (M/273FO/23) the 200/12 µg strength demonstrated consistent improvement 
in lung function parameters over baseline compared with placebo and with the monocomponents, except 
trough FEV1 of aclidinium/formoterol compared with formoterol 12 µg. The improvement seen with the 
lower strength in this study may be because it was of longer duration as the patient populations enrolled 
into the three studies had identical inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Overall there is little difference demonstrated between the strengths in these dose response studies. 
Therefore no firm conclusion can be drawn as to the optimal dose for the symptomatic treatment of 
patients with COPD. The applicant has opted to take forward the 400 µg strength of aclidinium following 
the licensing of this strength as the monocomponent but it may be that in combination with formoterol the 
200 µg strength is adequate. Unfortunately this strength has not been investigated in a Phase III study. 
Conclusions on the efficacy 
Additional analyses of the Phase II studies have been submitted to reassure that the systemic exposure, 
and hence efficacy, of formoteorl via the Genuair inhaler is sufficiently similar to that of formoterol via 
Aerolizer. Although there is an apparent decrease in the pulmonary deposition of formoterol when 
administered via Genuair compared to that when formoterol is administered via Aerolizer, this does not 
translate into a decrease in efficacy as measured by FEV1 AUC0-12/12 or FEV1 AUC0-3/3. Formoterol via 
Genuair can therefore be accepted as an appropriate comparator in the Phase III studies. 
The analyses of the pivotal studies and the sensitivity analyses provided are acceptable. The size of the 
placebo effect in study M/40464/30 was larger than expected. The Applicant has done all it can to try and 
explain this result but it remains unexplained. Therefore the results in this study for the SGRQ endpoint 
do not show an advantage for combination therapy over placebo.  
Generally aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 µg has demonstrated an improvement in lung function and TDI 
score when compared with placebo but has not consistently demonstrated an improvement when 
compared with the monotherapies, particularly the effect on trough FEV1 compared with formoterol 
alone. However this difference is similar to that seen with other recently licensed LABA/LAMA 
combinations and post hoc responder analyses for clinically meaningful effects on FEV1 and symptomatic 
endpoints provided by the Applicant support the conclusion that aclidinium contributes to a clinically 
significant extent to the overall positive effect of the combination aclidinium/formoterol. 
Additional analyses of the efficacy parameters in the long term studies have been provided using 
alternative models such as pattern mixture models. These were required as the drop-out rate in this study 
was high and hence the analysis provided using only completers could be biased in favour of the 
combination treatment group. The Applicant has provided further analyses that impute different penalties 
according to reason for withdrawal to give a fuller picture of whether the treatment effect is robust to 
assumptions made about subjects who withdrew from the studies. These additional analyses suggest that 
Assessment report

the likely effect after 52 weeks of aclidinium when added to formoterol is 0.067L (95% CI 0.003, 0.131) 
in a pattern mixture model with reasonable assumptions made to penalise dropouts in study LAC-MD-32. 
In contrast in study LAC-MD-31/LAC-MD-36 when the same comparison is made the estimated effect size 
is smaller (0.034L), and not statistically significant (95% CI (-0.014, 0.082). The estimated effect of 
formoterol on top of aclidinium is 0.085L (95% CI (0.036, 0.134)) and remains consistent in all the 
analyses. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The combination aclidinium/formoterol consists of two authorised active substances for which the safety 
profile has been previously well-characterised. Because of their different modes of action, one as a 
muscarinic antagonist and one as a beta2 agonist, their safety profiles do not overlap to any clinically 
relevant extent and so the combination is not expected to cause any additive safety issues. 
The safety assessment therefore concentrates mainly on adverse events of special interest and any 
unexpected adverse events. The main safety population consists of those patients enrolled in the Phase 
III studies. 
The initial aclidinium/formoterol clinical development programme investigated aclidinium/formoterol as 
an OD treatment for COPD and explored aclidinium 200 μg in combination with a range of formoterol 
doses, both administered OD (M/273FO/22, M/273FO/23, and LAC-MD-24). The dose regimen for 
aclidinium/formoterol was switched from OD to BID when results from Phase III clinical studies of 
aclidinium monotherapy indicated that the bronchodilator efficacy of aclidinium 200 μg OD was 
suboptimal and that higher daily doses and/or a different dose regimen were necessary. As a result, the 
dose regimen investigated in the aclidinium monotherapy development programme and in the 
aclidinium/formoterol development programme was switched from OD to BID. 
The clinical programme included four large Phase III studies. Two Phase III randomised, double-blind, 
parallel group placebo- and active-controlled pivotal studies (M/40464/30, LAC-MD-31) were conducted 
to demonstrate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg BID and 400/6 μg 
BID. Both studies included five treatment arms (aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg, aclidinium/formoterol 
400/6 μg, aclidinium 400 μg, formoterol 12 μg and placebo) and had a treatment duration of 24 weeks. 
Randomisation was stratified by smoking status (current or ex-smoker). The studies were comparable in 
design, with a 2- to 3-week run-in period to assess stability of COPD prior to initiation of study treatment. 
Patients completing LAC-MD-31 were given the possibility to continue on their initial treatment for an 
extension period of 28 weeks (LAC-MD-36). This extension study provides long-term safety, tolerability 
and efficacy data. The remaining Phase III study (LAC-MD-32) was a randomised, double-blind, parallel 
group active-controlled study conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 μg BID for a duration of 52 weeks by comparison with formoterol 12 μg BID. Three Phase II 
studies were also conducted with aclidinium/formoterol BID in patients with COPD. These were cross-over 
studies so it is difficult to allocated adverse events to a particular treatment. 
Patient exposure 
The study COPD population included was the same in all patient studies. The total patient exposure to the 
proposed dose of 400/12 µg aclidinium/formoterol for 1 year is 360 patients when the long term safety 
study LAC-MD-32 is included. In the placebo-controlled studies 127 patients were exposed to the 
proposed dose for at least 1 year. This is sufficient to fulfil the advised safety database of at least 100 
patients for at least 1 year. 
Assessment report

Given that there is already post-marketing experience with the two actives as monotherapies this safety 
database is considered to be adequate by the CHMP.

Adverse events 
Adverse events (AEs), including COPD exacerbations, were coded using MedDRA (Version 16.0). Within 
the BID programme, AEs were initially coded using the current MedDRA version available at the time of 
the study and were recoded as necessary using MedDRA Version 16.0.  
An AE was considered to be a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) if its onset date was on or after 
the date of the first dose of investigational product, or if its onset date was before the date of the first dose 
of investigational product and the severity increased on or after the date of the first dose of investigational 
product.

Data ordered by decreasing incidence in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg group. 
The most commonly reported TEAEs (incidence >5%) in patients treated with aclidinium/formoterol were 
exacerbations of COPD (PT: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), nasopharyngitis and headache. 
COPD exacerbations were reported more commonly for placebo (in 20.7% of patients) than for either 
aclidinium/formoterol group (in 17.1% and 18.1% of patients in the 400/12 μg and 400/6 μg groups 
respectively). The proportion of patients with severe COPD exacerbations (i.e. those requiring 
hospitalisation) was 4.6% for placebo, 4.0% for aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg and 3.8% for 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg.  COPD exacerbations led to permanent treatment discontinuation in ≤
2.5% of patients in any treatment group.

and LAC-MD-36 are counted only once.  
Table is ordered by decreasing frequency in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg group and then the 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg group.  
The number of patients in the Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population with TEAEs of severe 
intensity was comparable across treatment groups ranging from 9.5% to 10.8%. There was no evidence 
observed that the severity of TEAEs was increased by aclidinium/formoterol treatment. Exacerbations of 
COPD and pneumonia were the only TEAEs reported as severe in more than 1% of patients in any 
treatment group. The proportion of patients with severe COPD exacerbations was higher in the placebo 
group (4.6%) than either of the aclidinium/formoterol treatment groups (4.0% and 3.8%). Pneumonia 
was reported as severe for 1.1% of patients in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/6μg group but for 0.7% in 
the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg group which was comparable with placebo (0.6%). 
In the placebo-controlled trials the incidence of TEAEs was similar across the treatment groups. In the all 
Phase III Study population the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 µg group tends to a higher incidence of 
TEAEs, SAEs and deaths but this may be because of the addition of patients in the long term study 
LAC-MD-32 which compared aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 µg with formoterol alone. 
The incidence of TEAEs in the different SOCs is similar across the treatment groups. Only in the ‘infections 
and infestations’ and ‘investigations’ SOCs is the incidence of TAEAs slightly higher in the 
aclidinium/formoterol groups than in the other treatment groups. Despite the incidence of COPD 
exacerbations being lower in the combination groups than in the placebo group, the incidence of 
pneumonia was slightly higher (1.1%, 1.3% and 2.0% for the placebo, 400/12 and 400/6 groups 
respectively [Placebo-controlled Phase III population]). 
For cardiac disorders the incidence ranges from 4.2% in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 µg group to 
6.9% in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 µg group with an incidence of 5.5% in the placebo group. 
With regard to TEAEs of severe intensity the incidence of pneumonia is slightly higher in the two 
combination groups than the other treatment groups or placebo. Incidence of myocardial infarction is also

higher in the groups that included aclidinium treatment. However the numbers are very small so firm 
conclusions cannot be drawn. 
In general there are no striking differences between the treatment groups that raise safety concerns.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
The proportion of patients with treatment-emergent SAEs was low and comparable across all treatment 
groups, ranging from 6.8% to 8.1%. SAEs that were cardiac disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, 
infections and infestations, injury, poisoning and procedural complications, neoplasms benign, malignant 
and unspecified (including cysts and polyps), nervous system disorders, and respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders were the only SAEs (by SOC) that were reported by at least 1% of patients in any 
treatment group.

Includes data from studies M/40464/30, LAC-MD-31 and LAC-MD-36. Patients who participated in both LAC-MD-31 
and LAC-MD-36 are counted only once.  
Table is ordered by decreasing frequency in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg group followed by the frequency in 
the 400/6 μg group.  
As for the Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population, the most frequently reported SAE was 
exacerbation of COPD which in the All Phase III Study Population was reported by a slightly lower 
proportion of patients in the aclidinium/formoterol groups than for placebo. Pneumonia was the only other 
SAE reported by more than 1% of patients in any treatment group. This SAE was reported by 1.1% of 
patients in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg group but by a lower proportion of patients in the 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg group and placebo groups (0.8% in each group). Sudden death was the 
only other SAE reported by more than 3 patients in any treatment group 
The percentages of patients with serious adverse events are similar across the treatment groups. In 
looking at the particular events the higher dose of formoterol in the combination aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 µg appears to have a protective effect compared with the aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 µg and the 
aclidinium alone treatment groups with respect to COPD and cardiac events. However the numbers are 
very small so no firm conclusions can be drawn. There is no evidence of particular safety issues with the 
combination aclidinium/formoterol compared with the monocomponents. 
In the All Phase III Study Population there were no additional serious adverse events reported to conclude 
that the rate of adverse events increase over time. More deaths were reported in this population as it 
included patients enrolled into the extension 1-year studies. In this patient population with moderate to 
severe COPD it is not unexpected to have more deaths occurring over time. 
Deaths 
A total of 21 treatment-emergent deaths were reported in the Phase III studies with 
aclidinium/formoterol in patients with COPD.

Table 42: Number of treatment-emergent deaths in Phase III studies in patients with COPD 
(safety population) 
Includes deaths recorded during the study or within 30 days of the last dose of investigational product  
Study LAC-MD-32 only included AB/FF 400/12 μg and FF 12 μg treatment groups.  
The only TEAE with a fatal outcome that was reported by more than 1 patient in any treatment group was 
unexplained death (PT: death; reported for 1 patient in the placebo group, 4 in the aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 μg group and 1 in the formoterol group). These TEAEs were adjudicated by the Cardiovascular 
Adjudication Committee as sudden cardiac deaths of unknown aetiology for 3 patients in the 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg group and 1 patient in the formoterol group; cause of death was 
adjudicated as undetermined for 1 patient in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg group and 1 patient in 
the placebo group. All the patients whose deaths were adjudicated as a cardiovascular death had a 
significant pre-existing cardiovascular medical history, including ischaemic heart disease in most of them. 
Other reasons for death reported by more than 1 patient across the treatment groups were: exacerbation 
of COPD, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiac failure and myocardial infarction. No other TEAEs resulted in 
the death of more than 1 patient.

Table 43: Summary of TEAEs with fatal outcome in Phase III studies in patients with COPD 
(safety population) 
There was only 1 TEAE with a fatal outcome that was considered by the investigators to be study 
drug-related; this was experienced by patient 115431006 treated with placebo. This was in a 57-year-old 
male who had been in the study for 337 days at the time of death. The death was adjudicated as being of 
unknown cause. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Aclidinium/formoterol is a combination of aclidinium bromide, a long-acting anti-muscarinic agent with 
kinetic selectivity towards M3 receptors in the lung and formoterol fumarate, a long-acting β2-adrenergic 
agonist. COPD is associated with chronic co-morbid diseases such as cardiovascular disease and 
hypertension. 
Cardiovascular adverse events 
Two analyses were performed to evaluate the overall cardiovascular risk of the drug. The two analyses 
are: 
1. Analysis of MACE 
2. Analysis of cardiac events of interest based on standardised MedDRA queries (SMQs) 
Major Adverse Cardiac Events and events based on SMQs were analysed and presented for the 
Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population and for the All Phase III Study Population.

Analysis of Major Adverse Cardiac Events 
Major Adverse Cardiac Events were defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial 
infarction, and nonfatal stroke. A Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee, an independent external expert 
advisory panel, was set up to provide independent and objective review and adjudication of the Phase III 
clinical programme and to apply a consistent set of criteria for determining cardiovascular events. 
In the Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population no MACE signal was observed with either dose of 
aclidinium/formoterol. The incidence of MACE in the aclidinium/formoterol treatment groups was low and 
similar to that seen for placebo and monotherapies. The number of MACE was too small to draw any firm 
conclusions and there were no important differences between treatment groups in types of MACE 
reported. 
Table 44: Major Adverse Cardiac Events: Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population 
The following SMQs were selected to analyse the incidence of cardiac events of interest (myocardial 
infarction, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, angina, congestive heart failure, bradycardia and conduction 
defects). 
The proportion of patients reporting any cardiac event of interest was low (≤ 5% in any treatment group). 
The incidence was lower for aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 µg than for placebo and was similar for 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 µg and placebo. 
Table 45: Cardiac events of special interest by specific SMQ category: Placebo-controlled 
Phase III Study Population 
The majority of patients (all patients and those aged at least 65 years) who experienced cardiac events 
had a medical history of cardiovascular risk factors.  
The incidence of cardiac events of severe intensity was low (0.7% to 1.3%) across treatment groups and 
was mainly due to myocardial infarction events, which were similarly distributed across the treatment 
groups. The proportion of patients with severe events in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg group 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 110/136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(0.7%) was lower than for placebo (1.1%) and was similar to placebo for aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg 
(1.3%). Similarly, the proportion of patients with cardiac events that were SAEs with 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg (0.6%) was lower than for placebo (1.7%) and was similar to placebo for 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg (1.7%). There were no notable differences between treatment groups in 
the incidence of specific severe or serious cardiac events. 
Conduction defects 
Conduction defects were reported at a higher incidence (RR for events >1.5) for aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 μg than for placebo although the incidence was similar to that seen with formoterol monotherapy. 
The frequency was lower for aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg (1.1%). Atrioventricular block first degree, 
bundle branch block left and electrocardiogram QT prolonged were reported more frequently with 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg than for placebo but at a similar incidence to aclidinium or formoterol 
monotherapies. No conduction defects were of severe intensity. 
Table 46: Conduction defects reported as treatment-emergent adverse events: 
Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population 
Cerebrovascular events 
The narrow search SMQs of haemorrhagic cerebrovascular conditions and of ischaemic cerebrovascular 
conditions were combined to analyse cerebrovascular events. 
Table 47: Cerebrovascular events reported as treatment-emergent adverse events: 
Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population 
In the Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population, the number of patients with cerebrovascular events 
was <1% in all treatment groups and there were no notable differences between treatments. The 
majority of the cerebrovascular events reported were seen in LAC-MD-31/LAC-MD-36, likely reflecting 
the longer treatment duration (52 weeks) in those studies than in M/40464/30 (24 weeks).

Lower respiratory tract and pneumonia events 
Adverse events related to lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia (LRTI: includes the 
MedDRA HLT of lower respiratory tract and lung infections and additional PTs that include the word 
‘pneumonia’) were analysed. It should be noted that the clinical development programme did not require 
that diagnoses of pneumonia be confirmed by chest radiograph, and that the overall category of lower 
respiratory tract infection and pneumonia includes both pneumonia events as well as other types of 
pulmonary infections such as bronchitis. 
Table 48: Treatment-emergent and serious treatment-emergent adverse events of LRTI: 
Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population 
Includes data from studies M/40464/30, LAC-MD-31 and LAC-MD-36. Patients who participated in LAC-MD-31 
and LAC-MD-36 are counted only once.  
LRTI includes all events within the MedDRA high level term of ‘lower respiratory tract and lung infections’ and 
additional preferred terms that include the word pneumonia (including pneumonia aspiration, pneumonia 
pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pneumonia viral).  
Any preferred term that includes the word pneumonia is included in the ‘any pneumonia event’ category.  
The frequency of LRTI was lower with aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg (2.4%) than with placebo (3.2%). 
The frequency for aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg was similar to that seen with placebo (3.5%). The 
incidence of LRTI that were SAEs was low and similar for aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg and placebo.

Anticholinergic adverse events  
To investigate potential anticholinergic AEs, the SMQ for anticholinergic syndrome (MedDRA version 16.0) 
together with additional MedDRA PTs of sinus tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular 
tachycardia, heart rate increased, palpitations, angle closure glaucoma, glaucoma, intraocular pressure 
increased, intraocular pressure test abnormal, papillary reflex impaired, pupils unequal, visual 
disturbance, blindness transient, constipation, gastrointestinal obstruction, ileus paralytic, urinary tract 
infection, cystitis, urinary incontinence, incontinence, dysuria, urge incontinence, urine flow decreased, 
bladder irritation, oropharyngeal pain, dysphonia, laryngitis, pharyngitis, and throat irritation were 
analysed. There is some overlap in the potential anticholinergic TEAEs and potential β2-agonist TEAEs. 
Potential anticholinergic TEAEs that were also potential β2-agonist TEAEs included sinus tachycardia, 
tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, heart rate increased, palpitations, 
urinary tract infection, urinary retention, dizziness, constipation, vision blurred, throat irritation and 
mydriasis.

Few possible anticholinergic TEAEs were of severe intensity. In the All Phase III Study Population only 11 
patients reported possible anticholinergic TEAEs that were SAEs; 4 patients in the aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 μg group (ventricular tachycardia, constipation, urinary tract infection [2 patients] and ataxia), 1 
patient in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg group (constipation), 1 patient in the aclidinium group

dizziness and urinary retention). 
β2-agonist adverse events  
To investigate potential β2-agonist AEs the following SMQs and other terms were tabulated: hypertension 
(narrow search SMQ), hyperglycaemia/ new onset diabetes mellitus (narrow search SMQ), 
tachyarrhythmias (including supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias) (broad search SMQ), 
together with the HLT tremor and specific PTs for tachycardia, heart rate increase, palpitations, insomnia, 
vision blurred, mydriasis, nervousness, anxiety, headache, dizziness, dysgeusia, cough, throat irritation, 
myalgia, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, constipation, muscle spasm, hypokalaemia, oedema

Few possible β2-agonist TEAEs were of severe intensity and there were no important differences between 
the treatment groups. The incidence of possible β2-agonist TEAEs that were SAEs was also low. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematological data did not reveal any clinically relevant mean changes from baseline to end-of-study for 
any parameter in any treatment group. 
Mean changes from baseline to end-of-study for the chemistry parameters also showed no relevant 
changes or dose dependence in any treatment arm with the exception of creatinine kinase which showed 
changes in treatment groups that contained formoterol. At end-of-study there was a small decrease in 
creatinine kinase in the placebo and aclidinium groups compared with an increase in the 
aclidinium/formoterol and formoterol groups. Results for aclidinium/formoterol were similar to those seen 
with formoterol monotherapy. 
Only small mean changes were observed in potassium and glucose determinations at all time points 
assessed and changes were similar across the treatment groups 
TEAEs 
Only 2 patients reported TEAEs associated with notable haematology abnormalities, 1 patient treated 
with aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg and 1 patient treated with formoterol. Both patients had a notable 
abnormality of decreased platelet count. Patient 188331004 treated with aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 
μg experienced mild thrombocytopenia unrelated to study treatment. This patient subsequently 
developed severe anaemia and severe pancytopenia unrelated to study treatment; the pancytopenia led 
to permanent premature treatment discontinuation. The patient died 45 days after discontinuing study 
treatment due to respiratory failure unrelated to study treatment; as this death occurred more than 30 
days after study drug discontinuation it was considered to be non-treatment-emergent.  
Patient 1775.04, treated with formoterol, experienced a severe gastric ulcer haemorrhage that was not 
considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment. 
Very few patients reported TEAEs associated with notable blood chemistry abnormalities. Increased GGT 
was the notable abnormality most commonly reported as a TEAE at the end-of-study. This was the only 
notable abnormality with associated TEAEs reported by more than 2 patients in any treatment group. It 
was reported for 4 patients in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg group (associated TEAEs: gamma 
glutamyl transferase increased [3 patients], liver function abnormal [1 patient]), 4 patients in the 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg group (associated TEAEs: gamma-glutamyl transferase increased [2 
patients], hepatic enzymes increased and cholelithiasis [1 patient], myocardial infarction [1 patient]), 2 
patients in the aclidinium group (associated TEAEs: oesophageal adenocarcinoma [1 patient], hepatitis 
toxic [1 patient]) and 2 patients in the formoterol group (associated TEAEs: autoimmune hepatitis [1 
patient], alcohol poisoning [1 patient]). All these TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity with the 
exception of myocardial infarction in 1 patient in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg group, oesophageal 
adenocarcinoma in 1 patient in the aclidinium group and alcohol poisoning in 1 patient in the formoterol 
group. None were considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment. 
In the All Phase II Study Population results for blood chemistry notable abnormalities were very similar to 
those for the Placebo-controlled Phase III Population. One (1) additional patient (145032010) treated 
with formoterol had a notable abnormality in platelets and TEAEs of severe anaemia and severe

gastrointestinal haemorrhage were reported. These TEAEs were not considered by the investigator to be 
related to study treatment.  
Only 1 additional patient with a clinically significant notable abnormality at end-of study had a related 
TEAE reported: patient 158832006 treated with formoterol had notable abnormalities in ALT and AST, 
and hepatic enzyme increased was reported as a TEAE. The TEAE was considered to be of moderate 
severity and was not considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment. ALT increased from 
22 U/L at baseline to 130 U/L and AST increased from 33 U/L at baseline to 177 U/L 
Electrocardiographic values 
In each Phase III study, ECGs were reviewed at a centralised cardiology assessment vendor (eRT) in a 
blinded standardised manner by a cardiac safety technician and a cardiologist. However, only the 
investigator determined if an ECG abnormality was or was not clinically relevant. If it was clinically 
relevant, then an AE form should have been completed. 
For the Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population, baseline ECG values, including QTcF, QRS, PR and 
RR interval and heart rate were similar across treatment groups. In addition, mean changes from baseline 
showed no relevant between-group differences

Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors 
To investigate the effect of various intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the safety of aclidinium/formoterol, a 
number of subgroup analyses have been performed for the Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population 
and the All Phase III Study Population: 
•  Age: <65 years, ≥ 65 to <75 years, ≥ 75 to <85 years and ≥ 85 years 
•  Gender: male and female 
•  Race: Caucasian (White), non-Caucasian (Black, Asian and Other) 
•  Body Mass Index (BMI): Underweight to normal weight (BMI <25 kg/m2), pre-obese (BMI ≥ 25 
kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2) and obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) 
•  COPD severity: mild/moderate and severe/very severe. Severity was defined as follows: for all 
stages FEV1/FVC <0.70 and for Stage I (mild): FEV1 ≥ 80% predicted; Stage II (moderate): 
FEV1 ≥ 50% to < 80% predicted; Stage III (severe): FEV1 ≥  30% to <50% predicted; Stage IV 
(very severe): FEV1 < 30% predicted. 
•  Smoking status: current and ex-smoker

As expected, the incidence of TEAEs increased with increasing age of the population, but in all age 
categories the incidence of patients with any TEAE for patients treated with aclidinium/formoterol was 
similar to the incidence for placebo, as observed for the overall study population. Although the incidence 
of TEAEs was higher in female patients compared to males, within each subgroup, the incidence of 
patients with any TEAE for patients treated with aclidinium/formoterol was similar to the incidence for 
placebo. For Caucasian and non-Caucasian patients, BMI subgroups and subgroups based on COPD 
severity the incidence of patients with any TEAE for patients treated with aclidinium/formoterol was 
similar to, or lower than, the incidence for placebo. 
The proportion of patients with SAEs was similar for aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg and placebo in all 
subgroups with the exception of patients who were underweight to normal weight and patients with 
mild/moderate COPD where a higher proportion of patients reported SAEs with aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 μg. Also, in non-Caucasians, pre-obese patients, obese patients and patients with severe/very 
severe COPD a higher proportion of patients reported SAEs with placebo than with aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 μg.  
For aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg, the proportion of patients reporting SAEs was also generally similar 
to placebo with the exception of patients aged 75 to <85 years of age, non-Caucasians, patients who were 
under weight to normal weight and patients with severe/very severe COPD where more patients treated 
with aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg reported SAEs and obese patients where more patients reported 
SAEs with placebo. 
Pre-existing disease 
To investigate potential drug-disease interactions, subgroups based on any pre-existing disease reported 
in at least 20% of the population were defined for the Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population and 
All Phase III Study Population. Based on this criterion, subgroups were defined for patients with and 
without the MedDRA high level terms (HLTs) of “Gastrointestinal atonic and hypomotility disorders” and 
“Vascular hypertensive disorders” for both the Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population and All 
Phase III Study Population and for “Osteoarthropathies” for the All Phase III Study Population only. 
Adverse event data for patients with and without each pre-existing disease are presented. 
Within each subgroup, the incidence of patients with any TEAE for patients treated with 
aclidinium/formoterol was similar to, or lower than, the incidence for placebo for the Placebo-controlled 
Phase III Study Population. In each of the subgroups, the overall distribution of TEAEs was generally 
similar to that observed for the overall population. For the most commonly reported TEAEs by PT (COPD 
exacerbation, nasopharyngitis and headache), the comparisons of aclidinium/formoterol with placebo in 
each subgroup were generally similar to those seen for the overall population with the following 
exceptions: 
• 
In the subgroup with gastrointestinal atonic and hypomotility disorders, COPD exacerbations 
were reported more commonly in the aclidinium/formoterol groups (487.3 and 483.7 patients per 
1000 patient-years for 400/12 μg and 400/6 μg, respectively) than in the placebo group (459.9 
patients per 1000 patient-years) rather than more commonly in the placebo group. The 
incidences for aclidinium and formoterol monotherapies in this subgroup were 376.4 and 455.8, 
respectively). 
• 
In the subgroup without vascular hypertensive disorders, headache was reported more 
commonly in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 group (180.2 patients per 1000 patient-years) 
than in the placebo group (136.4 patients per 1000 patient-years) rather than at a similar

incidence but the incidence was similar to that seen in the formoterol group (192.5 patients per 
1000 patient-years). 
Results for the All Phase III Study Population were generally similar to those for the Placebo-controlled 
Phase III Study Population. In this population pre-existing osteoarthropathies (which include the PTs 
osteoarthritis and spinal osteoarthritis) were reported in at least 20% of patients overall. 
For patients with osteoarthropathies, the TEAE incidences were 1127 and 1159 patients per 1000 
patient-years for aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg and 400/6 μg, respectively compared with 1317 
patients per 1000 patient-years for placebo. For patients without osteoarthropathies, the TEAE incidences 
were 1047 and 1063 patients per 1000 patient-years for aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg and 400/6 μg, 
respectively compared with 1151 patients per 1000 patient-years for placebo. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
To investigate potential drug-drug interactions, subgroups based on concomitant medication use 
(concomitant medications used before and continued after the first dose of investigational product) were 
defined to examine AE data in patients who were or were not using the specified medications for the 
Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population and All Phase III Study Population. 
Subgroups were defined for short-acting β2-agonist use, xanthine use, inhaled corticosteroid use and use 
of drugs known to prolong the QTc interval (i.e., monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs], tricyclic 
antidepressants, macrolides, antihistamines, phenothiazines and class Ia antiarrhythmics).  
Short-acting β2-agonists, xanthines and inhaled corticosteroids were examined as these were COPD 
medications that patients were allowed to use concomitantly during the studies. Drugs known to prolong 
the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) interval are described in the prescribing information for 
formoterol as having the potential to potentiate the action of adrenergic agonists on the cardiovascular 
system.  
In addition, subgroups were defined for any concomitant medication used by at least 20% of the study 
population. Based on this criterion, additional subgroups were defined for patients using or not using 
antithrombotic agents, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, plain and lipid modifying agents, 
plain. 
In all subgroups the incidences of TEAEs with both doses of aclidinium/formoterol were similar to or lower 
than the incidence of TEAEs with placebo with the exception of patients using antithrombotic agents 
where the incidence was higher for patients taking aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg than for placebo 
(incidence of 1181 patients per 1000 patient-years compared with 1151 patients per 1000 patient-years 
for placebo). In this subgroup the incidence of nasopharyngitis was higher for aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 μg than for placebo (137.7 patients per 1000 patient-years compared with 79.0 patients per 1000 
patient-years. There were no appreciable differences between treatments for other commonly reported 
TEAEs. 
In patients using drugs known to prolong QTc, the incidence of cardiac disorders (including TEAEs 
reported as part of the ECG investigations HLT) was lower for both aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg 
(108.3 patients per 1000 patient-years) and 400/6 μg (121.3 patients per 1000 patient-years) than for 
placebo (197.8 patients per 1000 patient-years). There were no reports of ECG QT prolonged in patients 
treated with aclidinium/formoterol (either dose) and concomitantly using drugs known to prolong QTc. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The incidence of permanent treatment discontinuation due to TEAEs was low (6.8% overall) in the 
Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population. The proportion of patients with TEAEs leading to 
Assessment report

Page 120/136 
 
 
 
 
 
permanent treatment discontinuation was higher in the placebo group (8.4%) than in any active 
treatment group (5.7% to 7.2%). By SOC, TEAEs that led to permanent treatment discontinuation in 
more than 1% of patients in any treatment group were respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
and cardiac disorders. Tremor led to treatment discontinuation for 2 patients in the aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 μg group and no patients in any other treatment group. The other TEAEs, by PT, that led to 
permanent treatment discontinuation of 2 patients in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg group were 
death, acute myocardial infarction (also reported as the TEAE leading to discontinuation for 1patient in 
each of the other treatment groups) and pneumonia (also reported as the TEAE leading to discontinuation 
for 1 patient in the each of the placebo, aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg and formoterol groups); the 
episodes of acute myocardial infarction and of pneumonia in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg group 
were of severe intensity. 
Table 54: Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to permanent treatment 
discontinuation by preferred term in more than 2 patients in any treatment group: 
Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population 
Includes data from studies M/40464/30, LAC-MD-31 and LAC-MD-36. Patients who participated in both LAC-MD-31 
and LAC-MD-36 are counted only once. 
Table is ordered by decreasing frequency in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg group. 
Similarly in the All Phase III Study Population the proportion of patients with TEAEs leading to permanent 
treatment discontinuation was higher in the placebo group (8.4%) than in any active treatment group 
(6.2% to 8.3%). By SOC, TEAEs that led to permanent treatment discontinuation in more than 1% of 
patients in any treatment group were respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders and cardiac 
disorders 
As in the Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population, exacerbations of COPD were the only TEAEs 
leading to permanent treatment discontinuation reported by more than 1% of patients in any active 
treatment group and the frequency in the placebo group was similar to or higher than the incidence in 
either aclidinium/formoterol group or the monotherapy treatment groups. In the All Phase III Study 
Population, there were no additional reports of prolongation of electrocardiogram QT interval, tremor, 
acute myocardial infarction or pneumonia leading to the discontinuation in the aclidinium/formoterol 
400/12 μg group. Ventricular tachycardia leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was reported 
for 3 patients (0.3%) treated with aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg and no patients in any other 
treatment group. The ventricular tachycardia was resolved for all patients. Overall these data provide no 
evidence for any difference in safety of aclidinium/formoterol based on concomitant medication 
administration.

Post marketing experience 
Aclidinium/formoterol is not currently available in any country and thus there are no post-marketing data 
available for the FDC product. Formoterol has been commercially available since June 1990 (EU 
International Birth Date) and aclidinium since July 2012 and no safety concerns in patients with COPD 
have been identified. 
Aclidinium 
The post-marketing experience with aclidinium bromide is limited and the adverse events that have been 
reported are included in the proposed SmPC. 
The total number of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported up to 20 July 2013 was 908 (89 serious and 
819 non-serious). The reporting rate for the most frequently reported ADRs has been calculated based on 
the number of ADRs (n) in the population exposed (patient-years)during the 12-month period since first 
authorisation. In order to avoid numbers with multiple decimal digits the reporting rate is multiplied by 
104. 
Reporting rate: RpR=(n/patient-years)* 104 
Estimated patient exposure = 69,153 patient-years 
The most frequently ADRs reported (RpR >2) were cough, headache, dyspnoea, diarrhoea, nausea, dry 
mouth, vision blurred, dizziness and dysphonia.

n: number of adverse drug reactions 
ADR: adverse drug reactions, cumulative ADRs to 20 July 2013 
RpR: Reporting rate 
ADRs with RpR >1 but <2 (ordered by decreasing frequency) were palpitations, vomiting, chest 
discomfort, condition aggravated, pruritus, rash, tachycardia, swollen tongue, tremor, throat irritation, 
stomatitis, dysuria, urinary retention, dysgeusia, exacerbation of COPD and hyperhidrosis. 
Seven fatal cases (6 death of unknown cause and 1 late stage COPD) have been reported. Out of these 7 
fatal cases, 2 cases (1 death of unknown cause and 1 COPD) were assessed as not related by the 
company. In the remaining 5 fatal cases company causality was not assessable due to the lack of 
information. The reporters of these 5 deaths cases did not provide the causality assessment to aclidinium 
bromide. 
No cases of MACE (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or cardiovascular death) have been 
reported. Only one case of transient ischaemic attack was reported.

Formoterol 
Conversely post-marketing experience with formoterol fumarate dihydrate is extensive and the applicant 
has included the reported adverse events in the proposed SmPC. 
The most frequently reported AEs described in the literature are those known to be associated with 
β2-agonists. The safety and tolerability profile of LABAs support their long-term use in patients with 
COPD. In a post-marketing surveillance study of formoterol (Foradil®), data were collected for 5777 
patients aged 3 to 96 years, of whom 65% continued treatment for >12 months. The most commonly 
reported events, excluding those related to respiratory disease, were headache, tremor, palpitation, 
cramp and nausea/vomiting. It was concluded that formoterol appears to have been well tolerated by the 
majority of patients in this study, although the frequency of nausea/vomiting was greater than given in 
the SmPC.  
A total of 20 studies published between January 1990 and September 2012 were reviewed that evaluated 
the long-term use (>24 weeks) of formoterol, salmeterol or indacaterol in patients with stable COPD. No 
evidence of an association between LABA treatment and increased exacerbations was seen and there 
were no COPD-related AEs or deaths. LABA treatment was generally associated with significant or 
numerical reductions in COPD exacerbations compared with placebo. Incidences of COPD-related AEs 
were similar for active and placebo treatments. The incidence of AEs typically associated with the 
ß2-agonist drug class, such as tremor and palpitations, was low (often <1% of patients) and there were 
no reports of increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias. The systemic effects of ß2-adrenoreceptor 
stimulation, such as high glucose and potassium levels, were considered minor. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profiles of the two monotherapies have been previously well characterised and are well known. 
The concern in assessing the safety of the FDC aclidinium/formoterol is whether or not an additive effect 
is seen when the two actives are administered together in the same inhaler.  
Although the deaths are small in number it is of concern that more deaths occurred in the 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 group than in any of the other groups and that four of nine deaths were 
sudden, unexplained and considered to be of cardiac origin. Two of the other deaths were also sudden and 
of unknown cause and it was not known if they were of cardiac origin. 
Only one death, in the placebo group, was considered by the investigators to be associated with study 
medication . 
There was a small increase in the percentage of patients suffering a myocardial infarction in the 
combination and aclidinium alone groups compared with placebo and the formoterol alone group. 
However as the Applicant states the numbers are too small to draw any firm conclusions from this. 
Regarding conduction defects, there was a higher incidence of reports in the active groups than in the 
placebo group but the incidence was not greater in the combination groups than in the monotherapy 
groups suggesting that the reports seen reflect the effects of the monotherapies without any additive 
effect from combining the two actives.  
There have been concerns regarding a possible association between stroke events and anticholinergics 
following information in several publications. The PRAC has reviewed these and concluded that no 
regulatory action is required but stroke events with inhaled anticholinergics should continue to be closely 
monitored in the literature and via signal detection activities. However the safety data from the Phase III 
studies in aclidinium/formoterol do not suggest an increased risk of stroke with the combination.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 123/136 
 
 
 
 
 
The incidence of cerebrovascular events was similar across the treatment groups and was, in fact, lower 
in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg group than in placebo. There is a very small number of reports so 
no firm conclusion can be drawn but there is no evidence of an accumulative effect of aclidinium and 
formoterol when administered together. 
Cerebrovascular events have been included in the RMP as a potential risk and this is accepted. 
In general the incidence of LRTI and pneumonia events was no greater in the aclidinium/formoterol 
groups than in the placebo and monotherapy groups; however the incidence of pneumonia was higher in 
the combination groups compared with placebo and the monotherapies. In the All Phase III study 
population the incidence in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 µg and formoterol 12 µg groups increased as 
these therapies were included in study LAC-MD-32, reflecting further reports occurring over the one-year 
treatment period. However the total incidence of these events remained similar across the treatment 
groups and similar to placebo. 
As would be expected from the known pharmacology of the two actives, the incidence of anticholinergic 
adverse events and β2-agonist adverse events was higher in the active treatment groups than in the 
placebo group. However the incidence across the active treatment groups was similar and there is no 
evidence of an additive effect on adverse events of the two actives being administered in one combination 
inhaler. 
For the FDC product adverse events, serious adverse events, including deaths, TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation and adverse events of special interest have been collected and assessed in the 
Placebo-controlled Phase III Study Population and the All Phase III Study Population.  
In general the incidence of TEAEs were similar across the treatment groups and often lower in the 
proposed aclidinium/formoterol 400/12µg group than in the placebo group owing to an increased 
incidence of COPD exacerbations in the placebo group. Similarly SAEs were similar across the groups and 
no particular safety signals are seen.  
Of particular concern with these actives is cardiovascular safety and more sudden unexplained deaths 
were reported in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 µg group than in the other groups. Only one death was 
considered by the investigators to be associated with study medication but many of the reported deaths 
were sudden cardiac deaths of unknown aetiology. The Applicant has provided an analysis of the 
on-treatment deaths during the aclidinium/formoterol Phase III programme by population and by study. 
By virtue of their mechanisms of action aclidinium and formoterol are known to have adverse cardiac 
effects, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias including prolongation of the QTc interval and in light of 
the sudden cardiac deaths seen in the clinical programme strong warnings regarding cardiac effects are 
included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
The data on the incidence of LRTI and pneumonia events in the combination groups are reassuring. 
The subgroup analyses have not demonstrated any particular trend towards a decreased safety profile in 
any subgroup with aclidinium/formoterol compared with placebo or the monotherapies.  
Changes in laboratory parameters from baseline to end-of-study were generally similar across the 
treatment groups. There was some increase in GGT in the aclidinium-treated groups compared with 
placebo and formoterol alone and increases in LDH in the active treatment groups compared with placebo. 
Increases in GGT were reported with associated TEAEs in 4 patients in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 
μg group, 4 patients in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg group, 2 patients in the aclidinium group and 
2 patients in the formoterol group. However there was no consistent increase in other liver enzymes to 
suggest hepatic toxicity and no evidence of an additive effect of the combination groups compared with 
the monotherapies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/717942/2014  
Page 124/136 
 
 
 
 
 
There was no consistent effect on blood glucose or serum potassium of the active treatment groups 
compared with placebo. 
There was an increase in change from baseline in QTcF interval in the groups given formoterol either alone 
or in combination compared with the placebo and aclidinium monotherapy groups. The increases were 
small and not clinically significant but when the data were analysed according to the percentage of 
patients with a potentially clinically significant increase of >30msec there was an increase in all the active 
treatment groups compared with placebo. Likewise increases were seen in the active treatment groups 
for percentages of patients with an absolute QTcF value >480msec. Smaller percentages of patients had 
an increase in QTcF interval of >60msec or an absolute value of >500msec and the difference to placebo 
was not so consistent. 
However given the concern over the effects on QTc interval of the β-agonists this is highlighted in the RMP 
and monitored in the proposed PASS. 
The TEAEs leading to discontinuation were small in number and higher in the placebo group than the 
active control groups. Prolongation of QTc interval led to discontinuation in 5 patients, 3 in the 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg group and 2 in the aclidinium monotherapy group but none in the 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 μg group. Therefore this does not suggest an additive effect of aclidinium 
and formoterol on QTc prolongation. 
The applicant has investigated the incidence of TEAEs in patients using and not using concomitant 
medication that is commonly used in this patient population. In addition the applicant has investigated 
the incidence of TEAEs in patients concomitantly using drugs known to prolong the QTc interval. 
There are no signals from these data to suggest an adverse safety profile when aclidinium/formoterol is 
used concomitantly with other medication commonly used by patients with COPD. 
Regarding conduction defects and in particular effects on the QTc interval, there were more reports in the 
active therapy groups than in the placebo group but no consistent increase in reports in the combination 
groups compared with the monotherapy groups. Therefore these results are reassuring that there is no 
additive effect of the two actives when administered together. 
The data on the incidence of LRTI and pneumonia events in the combination groups are reassuring. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials  have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
From the safety data presented there are no particular safety signals that suggest an additive effect of the 
combination of aclidinium and formoterol when compared with the monotherapies.  
Cardiac safety is of particular concern and although there is no evidence of an additive effect on 
conduction defects there were more deaths reported in the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg group, than 
in the other groups. The Applicant has provided further information on these deaths and an amendment 
to Section 4.4 of the SmPC  has been made.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation 
measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication. 
2.9.  Product information 
QR Code 
The CHMP agreed in principle, with the inclusion of the QR code in the package leaflet linking to a video 
showing how to use the inhaler for Brimica Genuair, provided that the information will be in line with the 
agreed principles of acceptability of QR codes. It was pointed out that an URL should be included in the 
leaflet to enable patients/healthcare professionals without a smart phone access to the additional 
information.  
The PRAC considered the instructional video for the Genuair device was not necessary for risk 
minimisation and the reference to the QR code is not made in the RMP for Brimica Genuair. 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
A statistically significant and clinically relevant when compared with placebo in TDI focal score were 
observed during the clinical development program with aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg and 400/6 μg in 
both M/40464/30 (1.29 units and 1.16 units, respectively [p<0.0001 for both]) and LAC-MD-31 (1.44 
units and 1.40 units, respectively [p<0.0001 for both]), as well as in the pooled population from 
M/40464/30 and LAC-MD-31 (1.43 units and 1.33 units, respectively [p<0.0001]). 
In the pivotal Phase III studies aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg and 400/6 μg have been shown to give 
an improvement in lung function (FEV1 1hour post dose and trough FEV1) compared with placebo. This 
improvement is statistically significant and clinically relevant. The improvement in trough FEV1 is >100ml 
which is the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) that can be perceived by the patient.

Generally aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 µg has demonstrated an improvement in lung function and TDI 
score when compared with placebo but has not consistently demonstrated an improvement when 
compared with the monotherapies, particularly the effect on trough FEV1 compared with formoterol alone 
(difference of 68ml). However this difference is similar to that seen with other recently licensed 
LABA/LAMA combinations and post hoc responder analyses for clinically meaningful effects on FEV1 and 
symptomatic endpoints provided by the Applicant support the conclusion that aclidinium contributes to a 
clinically significant extent to the overall positive effect of the combination aclidinium/formoterol. 
In the pooled analysis of the results of the two pivotal Phase III studies a statistically significant 
improvement in the rate of moderate to severe exacerbations was demonstrated for 
aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg when compared with placebo but not for aclidinium/formoterol 400/6μg. 
However the actual difference in in exacerbation rate is 0.13 exacerbations per patient/year and it is 
debatable whether this is clinically relevant. 
In the dose-finding studies there was little difference in the effects of aclidinium/formoterol 200/12 μg 
and 400/12 μg but the two doses were not investigated in the same study. The applicant decided to take 
the 400/12 μg strength forward into Phase III following the licensing of the monotherapy at a strength of 
400 μg. Following a request from the CHMP the Applicant has performed a post hoc responder analysis, 
which shows a marked improvement of the aclidinium/formoterol 400/12µg over the 
aclidinium/formoterol 200/12µg strength in the percentage of responders in the endpoints most 
appropriate to aclidinium; FEV1 AUC0-12/12h and trough FEV1. From the aclidinium monotherapy 
programme it is accepted that the safety of aclidinium 400 µg is no less than that of aclidinium 200 µg and 
therefore it is accepted that the dose of aclidinium/formoterol is 400/12µg. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Although the combination of aclidinium bromide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate has demonstrated a 
beneficial effect on the rate of exacerbations of COPD compared with placebo the clinical relevance of that 
effect is not clear. No analysis was presented comparing the combination with the monotherapies so it is 
not known whether the combination gives a benefit on rates of exacerbation over aclidinium bromide or 
formoterol fumarate dihydrate alone. 
Additional analyses of the efficacy parameters in the long term studies have been provided using 
alternative models such as pattern mixture models. These were required as the drop-out rate in this study 
was high and hence the analysis provided using only completers could be biased in favour of the 
combination treatment group. The Applicant has provided analyses of the long-term safety studies that 
impute different penalties according to reason for withdrawal to give a fuller picture of whether the 
treatment effect is robust to assumptions made about subjects who withdrew from the studies, these 
analyses do not raise any concerns. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In general the number of drug related adverse events was low and the reported events do not give rise to 
any major safety concerns. A definite dose-related signal was not detected for any significant adverse 
event in the safety database presented for formoterol and aclidinium. Regarding the safety of the FDC 
aclidinium/formoterol there is no evidence of an additive effect when the two actives are administered 
together in the same inhaler. 
The safety profiles of the two monotherapies have been previously well characterised and are well known.

The adverse effects of formoterol fumarate dihydrate are set out in the SmPC for Foradil and the common 
effects are headache, tremor and palpitations. Uncommon adverse effects include agitation, dizziness, 
tachycardia and bronchospasm (including paradoxical bronchospasm). Formoterol, as with other 
β2-agonists may be associated with hyperglycaemia and hypokalaemia. It may also induce prolongation 
of the QTc interval. 
By virtue of their mechanisms of action aclidinium and formoterol are known to have adverse cardiac 
effects, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias including prolongation of the QTc interval and in light of 
the sudden cardiac deaths seen in the clinical programme the warnings regarding cardiac effects should 
be strengthened in Section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Other adverse effects of aclidinium bromide include nasopharyngitis, headache, tachycardia, cough, 
diarrhoea, dry mouth, blurred vision and urinary retention. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Both formoterol and aclidinium are known to have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system but as 
these effects are mediated via different pathways they are not expected to be additive. There is no 
evidence in the studies as presented that the safety of the combination is worse than that of the individual 
monotherapies. There were more reports of conduction defects in the active therapy groups than in the 
placebo group but no consistent increase in reports in the combination groups compared with the 
monotherapy groups. Therefore these results are reassuring that there is no additive effect of the two 
actives when administered together. Cardiovascular events and increases in the QTcF interval is included 
as important potential risks in the RMP and a warning has been included in the SmPC. Further data will 
also be collected in drug utilisation study (DUS) and post-authorisation safety study (PASS) as described 
in the RMP for aclidinium bromide to evaluate the overall mortality and the proposed cardiovascular safety 
endpoints (with an additional endpoint of cardiac arrhythmia) among patients with COPD using 
aclidinium/formoterol. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The combination product has demonstrated a clinically relevant effect on lung function and a symptomatic 
score of dyspnoea (TDI) when compared with placebo and this will improve the symptomatic control of 
moderate to severe COPD giving the patient a better quality of life. However it is not clear that the 
combination will give a clinically relevant benefit over formoterol fumarate dihydrate monotherapy. 
The improvement in lung function and dyspnoea may translate into a decreased risk of an exacerbation of 
COPD but the Phase III studies conducted were too short to demonstrate a decrease in the rate of 
exacerbations that would be clinically meaningful to the patient. 
The adverse effects of aclidinium bromide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate have been previously well 
characterised. The two actives act through different pathways and there is no evidence from the clinical 
programme that their effects are additive when administered together via the same inhaler. However 
both actives have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, in particular on cardiac rhythm, and 
therefore may be associated with sudden cardiac deaths. The patient population that suffers from COPD 
commonly have concomitant cardiovascular disease and therefore it is important that the combination 
demonstrates an additional benefit over the monotherapies.

Benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP considers that the available data provides evidence of clinically relevant effects of the 
formoterol and aclidinium FDC in the treatment of COPD without any significant increase in safety 
concerns. Therefore, the overall benefit/risk of Brimica is considered positive.  
The important benefits of the combination aclidinium/formoterol, two bronchodilators, on the symptoms 
of COPD are in the improvement in lung function and the patient’s perception of dyspnoea. This translates 
into an improvement in quality of life and possibly a reduction in the risk of an exacerbation. Against this 
must be weighed the additional adverse effects that may be experienced by the administration of two 
bronchodilators with different modes of action. The adverse effects that are of particular concern involve 
the cardiovascular system and may be associated with sudden cardiac death. Therefore the adverse 
effects of a second active must be balanced by additional clinically meaningful benefits. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Formoterol  and  aclidinium  has  shown  a  clinically  and  statistically  significant  effect  on  lung  function 
(trough FEV1) and symptomatic endpoint (TDI) as compared to placebo.  
Generally aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 µg has demonstrated an improvement in lung function and TDI 
score when compared with placebo but has not consistently demonstrated an improvement when 
compared with the monotherapies, particularly the effect on trough FEV1 compared with formoterol alone 
(difference of 68ml). However this difference is similar to that seen with other recently licensed 
LABA/LAMA combinations and post hoc responder analyses for clinically meaningful effects on FEV1 and 
symptomatic endpoints provided by the Applicant support the conclusion that aclidinium contributes to a 
clinically significant extent to the overall positive effect of the combination.  
It has been argued that a clinically meaningful improvement in FEV1 of 100ml cannot be achieved by both 
bronchodilators when administered together as maximum bronchodilation is limited in moderate to 
severe COPD. 
The available safety data on the formoterol and aclidinium FDC does not raise any particular significant 
safety concerns. The safety data from the Phase III programme do not suggest an additive effect of 
aclidinium and formoterol on cardiovascular adverse effects and there is no evidence that the risk of 
adverse effects increases with the duration of the treatment up to the one year duration of the safety 
studies. However adverse effects of both β-agonists and anticholinergics are seen in the study population 
so each needs to add benefit to the combination treatment. 
Sudden cardiac deaths were seen in the clinical development programme but generally not considered by 
the investigators to be related to study medication. Further information on these sudden deaths shows 
that the majority of the patients had pre-existing cardiac conditions that would have contributed to their 
death. As many patients with COPD have concomitant cardiovascular morbidities the warnings regarding 
cardiovascular disease in the SmPC have been trengthened.  
The overall long-term safety will be further characterized as part of the PASS (as described in the RMP). 
The proposed indication suggests that the combination product can be a first-line therapy in the 
treatment of all severities of COPD; however the patients enrolled in the Phase III studies had moderate 
to severe COPD in Groups B and D of the GOLD guidelines (more symptoms or history of 2 or more 
exacerbations) and therefore the indication should reflect the patient population in the Phase III studies. 
In the GOLD guideline on the treatment of patients with COPD LABA/LAMA combinations are not

recommended for patients in group A (patients with mild airway limitation, fewer symptoms and a history 
of no or one exacerbation).  
Taking the overall evidence of benefits and risks discussed above, the benefit-risk balance is considered 
to be positive. 
Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Brimica Genuair is positive.

APPENDIX:  
DIVERGENT POSITION EXPRESSED BY CHMP MEMBERS 
The totality of evidence available for this novel fixed dose combination is not conclusive. Consequently the 
benefit-risk is not considered to be favourable at present. 
-  A clinically relevant effect on trough FEV1 has not been demonstrated when the combination is 
compared to formoterol alone. Therefore, clinical relevance of adding aclidinium to the combination 
on pulmonary function is not justified. 
-  No “external” active comparators have been included in pivotal studies further complicating the 
interpretation of the poor differences obtained with the FDC versus the formoterol monocomponent 
in lung function or versus placebo in symptomatic endpoints. Although indirect comparisons with 
other FDC suggest a similar effect than other FDC, they should be interpreted with caution and 
cannot replace the evidence (not provided) from an appropriate direct comparison with a FDC 
approved for this indication. 
-  Moreover, there is limited short-term information regarding the impact of the combination on the 
rate of exacerbations as no specific studies have been carried out by the Applicant. Available 
6-month data suggest a poorer effect on COPD exacerbations versus placebo than that observed with 
other LABA/LAMA combinations. Again, these indirect comparisons should be interpreted with 
caution and cannot replace the evidence (not provided) from an appropriate 1-year exacerbation 
study.

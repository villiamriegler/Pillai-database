2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Among the Gram-positive bacterial pathogens S. aureus, whether or not it is methicillin-resistant, 
remains important, especially with the advent of aggressive community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) 
that express Panton-Valentine Leucocidin (PVL+). In the last decade three non-beta-lactam agents 
have become available for the management of MRSA infections (daptomycin, tigecycline and linezolid) 
but there is already some resistance to each of these. These agents have several drawbacks and 
limitations and there is a need for additional antibacterial agents to manage serious infections due to 
Gram-positive bacteria. There are currently no licensed beta-lactam agents that are considered to be 
reliably clinically active against MRSA because they are unable to achieve sufficient binding to PBP2a, 
which mediates methicillin resistance in almost all cases, to inhibit normal cell wall formation.    
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 10/122
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The clinical activity of beta-lactam agents that are used to treat community acquired pneumonia may 
be affected to a variable extent by alterations in pneumococcal PBPs that mediate intermediate or 
greater degrees of insusceptibility to penicillin. This is because the licensed agents do not bind so 
efficiently to altered PBPs compared to those in wild-types.  
The claimed indication and dosage for Zinforo at submission were: 
Indication 
“Zinforo is indicated in adults aged 18 years and older for the treatment of the following infections (see 
section 4.2): 
  Complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) 
  Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.” 
Posology 
“For the treatment of cSSTI, the recommended dosage of Zinforo is 600 mg administered every 12 
hours by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes in patients aged 18 years or older for 5 to 14 days. For 
the treatment of CAP, the recommended dosage of Zinforo is 600 mg administered every 12 hours by 
intravenous infusion over 60 minutes in patients aged 18 years or older for 5 to 7 days. The duration 
of treatment should be guided by the type of infection to be treated, its severity, and the patient’s 
clinical response. 
Special Populations 
Renal impairment 
The dose should be adjusted when creatinine clearance (CrCL) is ≤ 50 ml/min, as shown below (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
There is insufficient data to make specific dosage adjustment recommendations for patients with 
severe renal impairment (CrCL ≤30 ml/min) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), including patients 
undergoing haemodialysis. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dosage adjustment is considered necessary in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) 
No dosage adjustment is required for the elderly with creatinine clearance values > 50 ml/min (see 
section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Zinforo in children aged birth to < 18 years have not yet been established 
(see section 5.2). 
Method of administration 
Zinforo 
Assessment report

2.1.2.  About the product 
Ceftaroline is an oxyimino cephalosporin antibacterial agent for intravenous administration by twice 
daily infusion over 60 minutes. It is presented for clinical use as the more water soluble N-phosphono 
(fosamil), which is rapidly converted to ceftaroline itself by phosphatases in human plasma. The 
Zinforo

structures of ceftaroline fosamil, ceftaroline itself and the inactive ring-opened form, which is 
designated as ceftaroline M-1, are shown in figure 1. 
Figure 1. Chemical Structures of Ceftaroline Fosamil, Ceftaroline, and Ceftaroline M-1 
The spectrum of activity of ceftaroline is broadly suited to common pathogens implicated in the 
indications sought (community-acquired pneumonia [CAP] and complicated skin and soft tissue 
infections [cSSTI]). Ceftaroline is active in vitro against staphylococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci, 
Haemophilus and Moraxella spp. and most, but not all, enterobacterial species. The spectrum does not 
include the non-fermenting Gram-negative rods including Acinetobacter spp. and activity against 
anaerobes is genus- or species-specific.  
An inoculum effect was evident on in-vitro testing with several species expressing one or more beta-
lactamases that can hydrolyse cephalosporins to some extent. Ceftaroline may be readily hydrolysed 
by, and is therefore mostly inactive against, organisms that produce ESBLs (including, among others, 
TEM and SHV lineages), AmpC enzymes or carbapenemases (serine-based and metallo-enzymes).  
Unlike the currently licensed cephalosporins ceftaroline shows some ability to bind to and inhibit 
altered penicillin binding proteins that are associated with methicillin-resistant staphylococci and 
penicillin-insusceptible pneumococci. For example, most methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) are 
inhibited by 0.25-0.5 mg/l ceftaroline. There is an upward shift in MICs against MRSA with MIC90 at 1-
2 mg/l and occasional isolates require 4-8 mg/l for inhibition. The highest MIC observed from the 
Phase 3 clinical studies was 2 mg/l, which may not be reliably covered by 600 mg twice daily as 1-h 
infusions although this regimen is likely suitable up to MICs of 1 mg/l.  
Against 50 MRSA with well-characterised resistance phenotypes and genotypes the highest ceftaroline 
MIC values (2 to 4 mg/l) were observed among strains with SCCmec type I with a rank order of 
susceptibility according to SCCmec type of IV > II > III and I. 
S. pneumoniae MIC90 values are around 0.12 mg/l but with a shift up from the fully penicillin-
susceptible population (MIC90 0.015 mg/l) to non-susceptible (including penicillin-resistant with 
penicillin MICs ≥ 8 mg/l) strains (ceftaroline MIC90 0.25-0.5 mglL; regardless of serotype). Very few 
isolates required up to 2 mg/l ceftaroline for inhibition. In the phase 3 studies all pneumococci were 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 13/122
 
 
 
 
 
inhibited at 0.12 mg/l and most at < 0.015 mglL. Ceftaroline was very active in vitro against a range 
of S. pneumoniae strains including some strains that were non-susceptible to penicillin..  
Competition binding assays using S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, including strains that demonstrate 
PBP-mediated reduced susceptibility to penicillins, employed a range of methodologies. The IC50 for 
binding to PBP2a in MRSA was 0.16 mg/l while IC50 values for PBP1a and PBP2x/2a/2b of the 
pneumococcal strain selected were lower for ceftaroline than for penicillin or ceftriaxone. The effect of 
ceftaroline on purified transpeptidases derived from strains of both species with different 
susceptibilities to beta lactam drugs was assessed in several studies. The results supported conclusions 
that ceftaroline is less active against strains expressing altered PBPs compared to wild-types but was 
more active than comparator beta-lactam agents.  
Ceftaroline fosamil was approved for treatment of cSSTI and CAP in the US on 29 October 2010 under 
the brand name Teflaro® and with a different MAH to that proposed for the EU. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  medicinal  product  Zinforo  powder  for  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  is  a  sterile,  pyrogen-
free,  pale  yellowish-white  to  light  yellow  powder  blend  containing  668.4  mg  of  ceftaroline  fosamil 
acetic acid solvate monohydrate (equivalent to 600 mg of ceftaroline fosamil) and an alkalising agent, 
L-arginine, aseptically filled into 20 mL sterile vials. 
Zinforo is administered by intravenous infusion. The vial presentation is designed for single-dose use. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The  drug  substance,  ceftaroline  fosamil,  is  a  sterile,  semi-synthetic  prodrug  of  ceftaroline.  This  form 
was  chosen  due  to  the  solubility  limitations  of  ceftaroline.  Ceftaroline  fosamil  is  included  in  the  drug 
product  formulation  as  an  acetic  acid  solvate  monohydrate,  which  is  a  crystalline  solid  with  good 
stability.  
The chemical name of ceftaroline fosamil is (6R, 7R)-7-{(2Z)-2-(ethoxyimino)-2-[5-phosphonoamino)-
1,2,4-thiadiazol-3-yl]acetamido}}-3-{[4-(1-methylpyridin-1-ium-4-yl)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]sulfanyl}8-oxo-
5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate 
(monoacetate  monohydrate);  with  molecular 
formula C24H27N8O11PS4 and relative molecular mass 762.75 g/mol (solvate hydrate form). There is 
no Ph.Eur. monograph for ceftaroline fosamil. 
The  chemical  structure  of  ceftaroline  fosamil  has  been  confirmed  by  elemental  analysis  and 
spectroscopic methods: UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. All 
results support the proposed structure. 
Ceftaroline  fosamil  has  two  chiral  centres.    The  configuration  6R,7R  of  beta-lactam  is  defined  by  the 
specific  optical  rotation  of  one  of  the  starting  materials  which  is  obtained  by  fermentation.  Optical 
rotation is used to confirm the stereochemistry of ceftaroline fosamil. 
Polymorphism  has  been  investigated  by  DSC  and  XRPD  studies.  Data  provided  demonstrate  that  the 
same polymorphic form is maintained during the shelf-life of the product.

Manufacture 
The manufacturing process of ceftaroline fosamil consists of six chemical transformations and five 
purification steps. 
As ceftaroline fosamil is required as a sterile drug substance it is produced by sterile filtration, and its 
sterility is maintained by aseptic processing.  
The manufacturing process has been adequately described, and satisfactory specifications have been 
set for reagents, solvents and auxiliary materials used in the process. All critical in-process controls 
have been well established and justified. 
Satisfactory data for process validation and media fill simulation runs for validation of sterile filtration 
and crystallisation processes have been provided. 
The analytical methods have been satisfactorily described and validated according to ICH Q2 (R1).  
The drug substance is stored in a packaging system consisting of three sterile bags each sealed within 
each other. All bags are sterilised before use. The manufacturer has provided specifications for the

2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The drug product presentation is a sterile, pyrogen-free, powder blend containing ceftaroline fosamil 
acetic acid solvate monohydrate, and an alkalising agent, L-arginine, filled in 20 mL vials. 
Ceftaroline fosamil drug substance is a sterile, semi-synthetic prodrug which is rapidly cleaved upon 
administration to form ceftaroline. Ceftaroline fosamil was selected for development due to its 
improved aqueous solubility, as compared with ceftaroline. Ceftaroline fosamil acetic acid solvate 
monohydrate was selected for development as it can be produced as a crystalline form with good 
stability.  
A preliminar pre-clinical investigation showed that no efficacious plasma concentrations were achieved 
when ceftaroline fosamil was administered orally, thus the parenteral route of administration was 
selected. 
Initially, the manufacturer’s intention was to develop an aqueous ready-to-use solution formulation for 
infusion.  However, this was not feasible due to the limited stability of the prodrug in solution. 
Consequently, the manufacturer tried to develop a sterile dry powder product that could be 
reconstituted with a commercially available diluent at time of use.  
For the development of the manufacturing process consideration has been given to the possibility of 
terminally sterilising the finished vials, using the approach outlined in “EMA: Decision Trees for the 
Selection of Sterilisation Methods”. However terminal sterilization was deemed unacceptable for 
ceftaroline fosamil formulated drug product and assepting processing was chosen for the manufacture 
of the finished product. 
The development of the product has been satisfactorily described. Ceftaroline fosamil is an acidic drug 
with limited aqueous solubility. Therefore, an alkalising agent was required to aid the dissolution of the 
drug substance by increasing the pH of the reconstituted solution. L-arginine was chosen. 
Adventitious agents 
None of the materials used in the manufacture of Zinforo is of animal or human origin. 
Manufacture of the product 
Ceftaroline fosamil powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is manufactured via an aseptic 
manufacturing process similar to that used for other parenteral products.  
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 16/122
 
 
 
 
The manufacturing process has been sufficiently described and validated, and adequate in process 
controls are in place. The manufacturing process involves aseptically blending sterile ceftaroline fosamil 
powder and sterile L-arginine powder are aseptically blended to form ceftaroline fosamil bulk drug 
product powder blend, which is then filled into 20 mL vials.  
Product specification 
Appropriate  drug  product  specifications  have  been  set.  The  specification  for  Zinforo  is  typical  for  this 
pharmaceutical  form  and  include  tests  for  appearance  (visual  examination),  identification  (HPLC  and 
UV), clarity of solution (Ph. Eur.), constitution time, pH, assay as percent label claim (HPLC), impurities 
(HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.Eur.),  container/closure  integrity,  extractable  volume  (Ph. 
Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), particulate contamination (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxin (Ph. Eur.) and 
sterility (Ph. Eur.). 
The non-compendial analytical methods have been well described and validated in agreement with ICH 
guidelines. With regards to the method used for the quantitation of related substances in the drug 
product, the applicant has provided comparative analysis data from two commercial stability batches 
stored for 15 months at 25C/60%RH. The levels of related substances were calculated using an area 
normalisation method and an alternative calculation method. The CHMP recommends that the applicant 
should use both area-normalisation method and the alternative method to estimate the content of 
impurities in the first three drug product stability batches in order to determine if both methods give 
equivalent results. If significant differences in the content of impurities calculated with both methods 
are observed the analytical methods should be revised. However, this is not expected to be a risk to 
the patient as in all cases the levels of related substances were below the qualification threshold. 
Batch analysis results comply with the predefined specifications and confirm consistency & uniformity 
of manufacture and indicate that the process is under control.  
Stability of the product 
The  results  of long  term  (up  to  24  or 36  months  at  5±3°C), intermediate  (up  to  24  or  36  months  at 
25°C/60%RH  and  30o  C/75%RH)  and  accelerated  stability  studies  (6  months  at  40°C/75%RH)  have 
been  presented  for  three  production  scale  batches. Supportive stability  data  have  also  been  provided 
on three commercial scale batches stored for up to 18 months at 25°C/60%RH and 30°C/75%RH, and 
6 months at 40°C/75%RH. 
Results from a photostability study performed as per ICH Q1B guideline have also been provided. 
The test parameters evaluated in the stability studies were appearance, clarity of solution, constitution 
time,  pH,  assay,  degradation  products  and  water  content,  bacterial  endotoxins  and  sterility.  In  all 
cases  the  parameters  tested  remained  within  the  proposed  specifications  and  support  the  proposed 
shelf life for the commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SmPC.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Quality Development 
Information  on  development,  excipient,  manufacturing  process,  analytical  methods,  packaging  and 
control of the drug substance and drug product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. 
 The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product 
quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a

satisfactory  and  uniform  performance  in  the  clinic.  At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  there  were  no 
unresolved quality issues which could have an impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the medicinal product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following: 
The applicant should evaluate both area-normalisation method and an alternative calculation method 
to estimate the content of impurities in first three drug product stability batches in order to confirm if 
both methods give equivalent results. If significant differences in the content of impurities calculated 
with both methods are observed the analytical methods should be revised. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Ceftaroline is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin which has been developed as the prodrug ceftaroline 
fosamil because of the low water solubility of the antibacterial agent at physiological pH. Ceftaroline 
fosamil undergoes rapid biotransformation in plasma. The rationale for the development of ceftaroline 
was based on the high binding affinity for, and transpeptidase inhibition of, the penicillin-binding 
protein 2a (PBP2a), the mecA gene product of MRSA, and PBP2x in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae 
(PRSP), compared with commonly used beta-lactams.  
GLP 
The pivotal toxicology and the majority of the safety pharmacology studies conducted by the applicant 
were reported to be GLP compliant.  The safety studies that were not conducted to GLP were 
conducted to an appropriate scientific standard and justification has been provided by the applicant. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Ceftaroline inhibits bacterial cell wall biosynthesis through binding to the transpeptidase active site of 
penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which carry out the final steps in cell wall biosynthesis. Ceftaroline 
has been shown to bind with high affinity to PBP2a in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), relative 
to other beta-lactams in the class.  
The primary pharmacology of ceftaroline fosamil has been adequately characterised. 
In vitro activity of ceftaroline 
The spectrum of activity of ceftaroline includes many or most staphylococci, beta-haemolytic 
streptococci, Haemophilus and Moraxella spp., P. multocida and enterobacterial species but does not 
include the non-fermenting Gram-negative rods including Acinetobacter spp. and activity against 
anaerobes is genus- or species-specific. An inoculum effect was evident on in-vitro testing with several 
species expressing one or more beta-lactamases that can hydrolyse cephalosporins to some extent. 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 18/122
 
 
 
 
Ceftaroline may be readily hydrolysed by, and is therefore mostly inactive against, organisms that 
produce ESBLs (including, among others, TEM and SHV lineages), AmpC enzymes or carbapenemases 
(serine-based and metallo-enzymes).   
Against E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and other enterobacteria (including Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. 
and P. mirabilis) not over-expressing beta-lactamases or manufacturing enzymes able to readily 
hydrolyse ceftaroline the MICs are mostly < 2 mg/L. However, the MIC90s for Morganella morganii, P. 
vulgaris and Serratia marcescens were all 16 mg/L or higher and these species cannot be considered to 
fall into the spectrum of activity of ceftaroline. MIC90 values from surveillance studies are highly 
variable depending on the rates and types of beta-lactamases produced in individual collections of 
organisms. Isolates of enterobacteria that could be considered within the spectrum of activity of 
ceftaroline showed that ceftazidime-resistant bacteria usually required at least 16 mg/L ceftaroline for 
inhibition. However, these isolates were in the minority and there was a large separation evident 
between the susceptible population (MICs usually 0.5 mg/L or less) and the resistant population (16 
mg/L or more).  Among the anaerobes, ceftaroline appears likely to be active against Porphyromonas 
asaccharolytica and several Fusobacteria spp. and Veillonella spp. The Gram-positive anaerobes are 
more likely to be susceptible, including most Peptostreptococcus spp. and Eubacterium spp. whereas 
clostridial species (including C. perfringens) appear to have higher MICs and MIC90 values of around 
4-8 mg/L. Ceftaroline is not active against Mycoplasma or against intracellular Chlamydia or Legionella. 
Ceftaroline demonstrated time-dependent killing. Maximum rates of killing were generally observed at 
≥ 2 x MIC. Bactericidal effects (≥ 3-log10 killing) occurred within 8 to 24 hours. Single-point kill rates 
for 6 S. aureus doubled or quadrupled in the presence of 50% human serum. In the presence of 
serum, the kill-rates for E. coli increased by 1/2, while those for K. pneumoniae were increased 4-fold. 
The post-antiibiotic effects determined in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model showed short to 
modest PAE with S. pneumoniae or E. coli. PAE for S. aureus were in the range 0.8 to 7.2 h and for 
MRSA 3.8 to 4.8 h but there was no PAE against highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Variable 
results have been obtained in other experimental settings and using other strains. 
In vivo studies 
The activity of ceftaroline has been evaluated in vivo in a variety of animal models of infection. In early 
pre-clinical  studies,  efficacy  was  demonstrated  in  mouse  lung,  thigh,  and  peritonitis  infection  models 
against  Gram-positive  and  Gram-negative  organisms.  The  murine  thigh  model  was  employed  to 
characterize  the  in  vivo  time  course  of  antibacterial  activity  of  ceftaroline  fosamil  and  determine  the 
PK/PD  index  and  the  index  magnitude  predictive  of  efficacy  to  provide  guidance  for  dosing  regimen 
design  in  human  clinical  trials.  Ceftaroline  fosamil  efficacy  was  confirmed  in  a  further  murine 
pneumococcal  pneumonia  model  using  human  simulated  dosing.  During  the  procedure,  the  applicant 
informed CHMP that some errors (concerning the free drug % f T >MIC and calculated arithmetic mean 
values  necessary  for  ceftaroline  doses  to  demonstrate  net  stasis,  1-log10  kill  and  2 log10  kill  against 
the 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 2 Escherichia coli strains tested) in the initial murine thigh and lung 
models  were  spotted  and  have  been  corrected  and  that  the  PK/PD  target  for  Enterobacteriaceae  was 
recalculated.  Ceftaroline  in  vivo  efficacy  was  demonstrated  in  rat  endocarditis  models  against  MSSA 
and  staphylococcal  (MRSA,  GISA,  hGISA)  and  E.  faecalis  (VSE  and  VRE)  endocarditis  models  in  the 
rabbit,  in  addition  to  a  rabbit  model  of  staphylococcal  (MRSA,  GISA)  osteomyelitis.  Development  of 
ceftaroline  resistance  in  vivo  was  also  assessed  in  the  same  rabbit  endocarditis  model  using  sub-
therapeutic  doses  to  induce  the  emergence  of  resistant  variants.  Ceftaroline  fosamil  in  vivo  efficacy 
was also evaluated in a rabbit pneumococcal (PSSP, PISP, PRSP) pneumonia model. Finally, ceftaroline 
fosamil was also studied in an experimental model of meningitis in the rabbit against strains of E. coli 
(ceftaroline MIC of 0.06 mg/L) and K. pneumonia (ceftaroline MIC of 1 mg/L).

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Ceftaroline fosamil and ceftaroline were tested in a panel of 339 in vitro enzyme, radioligand and 
electrophysiologic assays in order to assess pharmacological activity unrelated to the therapeutic 
target.  
The secondary pharmacology assays demonstrated that ceftaroline fosamil (but not the metabolite, 
ceftaroline) possessed inhibitory activity at the Cav1.2 channel; however, the observed effect was not 
deemed to be clinically relevant.  No effects were observed at the 338 other targets tested. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology programme assessed the CNS, cardiovascular, renal and respiratory effects 
of ceftaroline fosamil and ceftaroline in vitro and single dose in vivo studies in the rat and monkey.

During studies to evaluate the effects of ceftaroline fosamil on the central nervous system, tonic 
seizures, convulsions and/or pro convulsant activity were observed at ceftaroline exposures (Cmax) 
that were > 20 fold higher than the proposed clinical Cmax.  In addition, a series of safety 
pharmacology studies were performed to investigate the effects on the cardiovascular system.   
Although hERG inhibition was observed with ceftaroline (IC50 656 micrograms/mL), no effect on action 
potential duration was observed during a dog Purkinje fibre assay and ceftaroline fosamil had no effect

on QT interval in vivo (monkey).  The results generated did not indicate a potential for QT prolongation 
in man.   
Effects on respiratory function (increased respiration rate and decreased tidal volume) were observed 
in the rat.  As there was no effect on the minute volume and given the transient nature of these effects 
and the exposures at which they occurred, the observed effects on respiratory function were not 
considered to be clinically relevant by CHMP. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been assessed with ceftaroline in combination with a variety 
of antibiotics in 3 in vitro studies against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens including 
important drug-resistant strains (study P0903-M-020, study NSR-P0903-M-045, study NSR-P0903-M-
043).   
The results of these drug interactions studies revealed no instances of antagonism when ceftaroline 
was combined with the other commonly used antimicrobials. Several antimicrobials, including 
meropenem, amikacin and piperacillin-tazobactam led to synergistic effects in combination with 
ceftaroline against the specific strains tested.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic profile following repeated intravenous administration of ceftaroline fosamil was 
evaluated during the repeated dose toxicity studies conducted in the rat and monkey at up to 1000 
and 400 mg/kg/day, respectively.  Exposures (Cmax and AUC) to ceftaroline fosamil were significantly 
lower than those observed for ceftaroline.  Exposures to ceftaroline increased in a dose-proportional 
manner and no accumulation of ceftaroline fosamil or ceftaroline was observed on repeated dosing.  
Ceftaroline was also readily absorbed following intramuscular administration.   
Following intravenous administration of radiolabelled-ceftaroline fosamil, drug related radioactivity was 
rapidly and widely distributed and the highest tissue/plasma ratio was observed in the kidney, which 
correlates with the route of elimination and the target organ toxicity observed.  Distribution into the 
lung, bone tissues and cerebrospinal fluid was also observed. 
A series of in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that the transformation of ceftaroline fosamil 
is mediated by a phosphatase enzyme and that the metabolism of ceftaroline fosamil and/or ceftaroline 
is not likely to be mediated by CYP enzymes.  In vivo, ceftaroline and ceftaroline M-1 (its inactive 
metabolite) have been identified as the predominant metabolites in mice, rats, monkeys and humans 
and urinary excretion was the principal route of elimination in both animals and humans.   
The in-vitro data provided to date have shown that at the proposed clinical dose, the potential for 
pharmacokinetic interactions between ceftaroline fosamil and concomitantly administered medicinal 
products is low.   
Single dose toxicity 
Two single dose toxicity studies were conducted: study TAK-599-00012 in the rat and study TAK-599-
00014 in monkeys. No mortality was observed following single intravenous doses of ceftaroline fosamil 
at up to 2000 mg/kg.  In the rat, prone position and tonic/clonic convulsions were noted at > 1000 and 
2000 mg/kg, respectively.  In the monkey, mydriasis was observed at > 200 mg/kg.  Discoloured urine 
was noted in both species. 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 21/122
 
 
 
 
Repeat dose toxicity 
4 repeated dose toxicity studies of up to 13 weeks duration (studies TAK-599-00081, TAK-599-00015, 
CXL-TX-02 and P0903-T-010) were performed in the rat, whereby ceftaroline fosamil was administered 
intravenously via either a slow bolus injection or infusion.  
5 repeated-dose toxicity studies of up to 13 weeks duration (studies TAK-599-00082 and -00083, TAK-
599-00037, CXL-TX-03, P0903-T-011) were performed in the monkey, whereby ceftaroline fosamil was 
administered intravenously via either a slow bolus injection or a 60 minute infusion.   
The CHMP considered that the performed studies were appropriate for the proposed clinical duration, 
although it was noted that in the majority of the rat studies, ceftaroline fosamil was administered as a 
slow bolus injection, whereas in humans it will be administered via a 60-minute infusion.  The Cmax 
values for ceftaroline at the no-effect levels in the rat are 9- to 12-fold higher than the proposed 
clinical C max which was considered acceptable.  However, the corresponding safety margins in terms of 
AUC were below 1 (0.65 to 0.9). 
The exposure margins (Cmax and AUC) based on the no-effect levels from the monkey studies range 
from 0.4 to 2.   
During the 4-week studies conducted in the rat and monkey, where ceftaroline fosamil was 
administered either alone or in combination with a β-lactamase inhibitor (which is still in development), 
ceftaroline fosamil was administered as a 60-minute intravenous infusion.  When ceftaroline fosamil 
was administered alone, in the kidney, no effects were observed in the rat at 200 mg/kg/day, minimal 
effects were noted in the monkey at 100 mg/kg/day and hence, the NOAELs for these studies were 
higher than those observed for the pivotal 4- and 13-week studies.  The NOAEL variability for the 
studies in the rat may be linked to observed differences in plasma Cmax. 
The findings were typical of cephalosporins, whereby the main target organs were the kidney (cloudy 
urine, deposition of granular material (cytoplasmic lysosomes) in the epithelium of  the renal collecting 
tubules in the papillary region accompanied by swelling. dilatation of the renal tubules and pelvic 
cavity, pigmentation/hypertrophy/regeneration of renal collecting ducts), central nervous system 
(mydriasis, tonic/clonic convulsions) and the spleen(enlargement of spleen germination centres).  The 
no-effect levels for the pivotal toxicity studies were primarily based upon the histopathological findings 
in the kidney and it is plausible that the renal effects may be partially responsible for the observed 
mortality at higher doses.  Renal microscopic changes included collecting duct hypertrophy or 
vacuolation and deposition of foreign material associated with granuloma formation.  Renal and urinary 
disorders (between 1/1000 and 1/100) and hepatobiliary disorders (between 1/100 and 1/10) have 
been reported in humans.  Moreover, other members of this pharmacological class of compounds 
(cephalosporins) are associated with renal toxicity.  Appropriate precautions for patients with renal 
impairment have been included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC, which was agreed by the CHMP. 
Haematuria and yellow cloudy urine were observed during the 4-week intravenous studies in the rat 
and monkey, respectively and orange urine was observed during the reproductive toxicity studies in 
the rat.  The urinary discolouration was attributed to excretion of the test article or a metabolite.  In 
addition, decreased erythrocyte number, haematocrit and haemoglobin were observed in the monkey 
and the Coomb’s test (often used to detect antibody-mediated destruction of red blood cells) 
demonstrated that the development of detectable antibodies was higher in patients treated with 
ceftaroline when compared to ceftriaxone.  However, no significant changes in haematology or serum 
biochemistry parameters were observed to suggest the existence of haemolysis during the phase 2 or 
phase 3 trials.

Genotoxicity 
A series of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies with ceftaroline fosamil and the active metabolite 
ceftaroline was conducted.  Ceftaroline fosamil and ceftaroline caused an increase in chromosomal 
aberrations in vitro.  However, the two compounds were non-mutagenic in the Ames test, did not 
induce DNA damage in rat hepatocytes and did not cause chromosomal aberrations in vivo.  Given that 
other cephalosporins have a similar profile to that observed with the test articles the CHMP agreed that 
administration of ceftaroline for up to 14 days is not likely to pose a genotoxic risk to humans. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed. The CHMP considered that the absence of carcinogenicity 
studies was acceptable, as such studies are not required given the proposed duration of treatment and 
the fact that the ceftaroline fosamil is not considered to pose a genotoxic risk.

Reproduction Toxicity 
A series of reproductive toxicity studies in the rat and rabbit was conducted to evaluate the effects of 
ceftaroline fosamil on fertility and embryofetal development.  Ceftaroline fosamil had no effect on male 
or female fertility (rat) and did not appear to be teratogenic in the rat or rabbit at the doses evaluated.  
However, during the definitive rat embryofetal development study, there was some evidence of 
reduced fetal weight at > 100 mg/kg/day; it was suggested that the observed fetal weights were 
within the range observed for historical controls.  In addition, although no dose-response relationship 
was observed, delayed ossification was noted in the rat at >30 mg/kg/day. 
Given that a reduction in fetal weight was observed in both the preliminary and the definitive studies 
and that the exposures observed at 30 mg/kg day are below the proposed clinical exposures, the 
CHMP requested the applicant to include the observed effects on fetal weight and ossification in the 
relevant sections (4.6 and 5.3) of the SmPC. The SmPC was subsequently updated. 
No new toxicities were identified during a juvenile toxicity study conducted in the rat. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetics of ceftaroline fosamil and ceftaroline was evaluated in the toxicology studies in rat and 
monkey. The analytical methods used for the toxicokinetic analyses for the pivotal toxicity studies were 
sufficiently validated. Ceftaroline fosamil was administered as repeated iv doses in ranges of 30 to 
1000 mg/kg in rats, and 8 to 400 mg/kg in monkeys. The Cmax and AUC of ceftaroline fosamil were 
significantly lower than those of ceftaroline. In both rats and monkeys, the Cmax and AUC of 
ceftaroline increased in an approximately dose proportional manner within the dose range studied. No 
differences were noted in either species with respect to gender in the PK parameters of ceftaroline 
fosamil, ceftaroline, or ceftaroline M-1. In addition, there was no accumulation of ceftaroline fosamil 
and ceftaroline after repeated once-daily administration, and only moderate accumulation of ceftaroline 
M-1 was observed in these studies. 
Local Tolerance  
During the studies designed to assess local tolerance in the rabbit, no histological changes were 
observed at the injection site; hence, the local irritancy potential of the formulations evaluated appear 
to be negligible.  The concentration of ceftaroline fosamil evaluated during the local tolerance studies 
was 4.17 mg/mL.  However, according to the proposed SmPC, ceftaroline fosamil (600 mg) may be 
administered in a total volume of 50, 100 or 250 mL, which corresponds to administration of 12, 6 or 
2.4 mg/mL solutions respectively.  There is some evidence (from both the repeated-dose non-clinical 
studies and the clinical studies) to suggest that ceftaroline fosamil may cause irritancy at the injection 
site (at ≥4.17 mg/mL).  Hence in order to support intravenous administration of a 12 mg/mL solution, 
a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteers is being performed by the applicant to investigate 
tolerability and irritancy at the injection site. 
Other toxicity studies 
Although cephalosporins have sensitisation potential, ceftaroline fosamil, when tested alone, had no 
antigenic potential in both the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and active systemic anaphylaxis assays 
in the guinea pig.  However, ceftaroline does have the potential to cause sensitisation under conditions 
of immunostimulation.  Moreover, there are clinical data to suggest that ceftaroline may be associated 
with the risk of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis.

In the mouse, cephalosporins typically increase immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels due to proliferation of 
the IgM-producing cells in the splenic germinal centres, causing splenomegaly.  In the rat, 
repeated-administration of ceftaroline fosamil decreased serum IgG levels in the absence of any 
changes in IgM at exposures that were higher than those proposed clinically.  In addition, the splenic 
changes noted (hypertrophy of the lymphoid follicles) were of minimal to mild severity.  In the 
13-week monkey study, splenic changes of mild severity were also observed (reversible) at clinical 
exposures in the absence of any effects on IgG or IgM.  Taken together, the decreased serum IgG (rat 
only) and the observed splenic changes were not considered to be of clinical significance, and hence, 
further studies to evaluate immunotoxicologic potential were not performed. 
The proposed levels of the impurities U1, U2 and U9 as outlined by the drug substance specification 
(≤0.5, 0.3 and 0.6%, respectively) are considered to be qualified from a toxicological point of view.  
The limit as outlined by the drug product specification for the ceftaroline fosamil-arginine adduct 
(<1.5%) is also acceptable and the applicant has clarified that this impurity does not pose a genotoxic 
risk. 
Phototoxicity studies have not been performed.  The absorption spectrum for ceftaroline fosamil 
indicates that no relevant absorption was observed within the 290 to 700 nm range.  Hence, the non-
clinical data generated thus far do not suggest that ceftaroline fosamil has the potential to cause 
phototoxicity. Following repeated intravenous administration of 14C-ceftaroline fosamil, elimination of 
radioactivity was relatively slow from the kidney, skin and thyroid, whereby radioactivity was still 
detectable 14 days after the final dose. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has conducted a series of studies to investigate the potential for ecotoxicity and the 
results suggest that ceftaroline fosamil will not constitute a risk to the environment. Below a summary 
of the main results:

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pro-drug, ceftaroline fosamil is hydrolysed to ceftaroline by plasma phosphatases.  Ceftaroline is 
active in vitro against staphylococci, beta-haemolytic streptocococci, Haemophilus and Moraxella spp. 
and most enterobacterial species. The spectrum does not include the non-fermenting Gram-negative 
rods including Acinetobacter spp. and activity against anaerobes is genus- or species-specific.  
The findings during the safety studies were generally typical of cephalosporins, whereby the main 
target organs were the central nervous system, kidney and the spleen (for details see above).  There 
were no findings indicative of a genotoxic or teratogenic risk for humans; however, reduced fetus body 
weight and incomplete ossification were observed during the rat embryofetal development studies.  In 
addition, the studies conducted to date do not indicate a potential to cause local irritancy or haemolysis 
following intravenous administration of 4.17 and 12 mg/mL formulations, respectively.  A Phase I 
study to investigate tolerability and irritancy at the injection site is ongoing and was deemed by CHMP 
as sufficient to generate data which could support intravenous administration of the proposed clinical 
formulation at 12 mg/mL.

2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP agreed that the presented data do not raise any major safety concerns and the non-clinical 
programmewas considered acceptable.  The primary pharmacology of ceftaroline has been adequately 
characterised. Repeat dose toxicity studies showed that the main target organs were the kidney, the 
central nervous system and the spleen, as for all cephalosporins. Appropriate precautions for patients 
with renal impairment have been included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
Initial application dossier 
The  application  dossier  stated  in  its  overview  and  individual  study  reports  that  study  protocols  and 
amendments,  informed  consent  forms,  information  sheets  and  advertisements  were  approved  by  the 
Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee at each study centre in conformance with 
International  Conference  on  Harmonisation  (ICH)  Guidelines  E6  and  E3,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations 
(CFR),  Part  56,  ethical  principles  stated  in  the  “Declaration  of  Helsinki,”  and  in  accordance  with  the 
laws and regulations of the country in which the research was conducted.   
There were four Phase 3 efficacy studies in this application – 06 and 07 in cSSTI and 08 and 09 in CAP.  
Since ceftaroline had already been approved in the US based on the same clinical studies as included in 
the EU application dossier, the US FDA had already conducted its own inspection of study sites in 
accordance with routine practise.  
The  US inspections included  the  sponsor  (Cerexa) and  two  study  sites  from each  of  the  four  Phase  3 
studies (total 8 sites). These sites were scattered worldwide and several of the highest enrollers were 
audited on several occasions. Specifically, the US FDA had inspected two sites in the US (contributing 
to 06 and 07), three sites in Russia (contributing to 06, 07 and 09), two in the Ukraine (contributing to 
08  and  09)  and  one  in  Georgia  (study  08).  There  were  no  significant  findings  reported  by  the  US 
inspectors. During the course of the studies the sponsor (Cerexa) had also audited 18 sites in study -
06, 22 in -07, 19 in -08 and 18 in -09. These sites were scattered worldwide and several of the highest 
enrollers were audited on several occasions.  
EU GCP inspection and findings 
During the initial review phase the EMA selected the Zinforo application dossier to be subject to a 
routine GCP inspection (i.e. this was not triggered by the assessment teams). 
The EMA selected two sites from study 07 (one site contributed 22 patients and the other contributed 
51 patients) as well as the sponsor (Cerexa) for the GCP inspection. The two sites were not the highest 
enrolling in the overall study but one site was the highest enroller in the US. Cerexa had itself audited 
the two sites (on two occasions in one case) during the conduct of the study. 
In the GCP inspection report (11 August 2011) the most important conclusions were: 
Regarding the US sites inspected: 
o  At one of the inspected sites, a number of critical and major findings regarding administrative 
aspects, third party contracts, study management, data handling, storage and accountability of 
IMP and treatment administration) have been observed.. It was recommended to consider 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 27/122
 
 
 
 
excluding the data from this site from the overall analyses due to the critical and major 
findings observed. 
o  The other inspected site  did not have any critical findings and the deficiencies observed did 
not have an impact on the reliability of the data. 
Regarding the US sponsor:  
o  There is a need for improvement of the quality management system of the sponsor and of the 
CROs. 
o  The sponsor did not adequately oversee the activities delegated to the CROs.  
o  The CRO that managed/monitored US sites  did not adequately identify deficiencies at the two 
sites inspected. 
o  Given the critical and major findings observed and the possibility that these problems could 
have been repeated in other investigational sites, a negative impact on the full study  could not 
be excluded. 
o  The inspectors concluded that it would not be recommended to accept the reported data for 
the decision about marketing authorisation at this stage. 
Consequently, the Rapporteurs, inspectors and EMA held a discussion 16 August 2011 to ensure the 
findings were fully understood and then held a discussion with the applicant on 24 August 2011 to hear 
the applicant’s plans to address the most important issues raised, while the assessment of the 
responses to the D120 list of questions (LOQ) was ongoing.  
Applicant’s actions and responses to the GCP inspection findings 
On 24 August 2011 Astra-Zeneca participants stated that they had already held internal discussions 
regarding how to address the issues, taking into account that many of the observations indicated that 
Cerexa and/or the CRO that monitored the US sites in study 07 and/or the sites needed to improve 
their practises but not all had the potential to directly impact on the acceptability of the data. They had 
already identified five specific inspection findings that, in their view, had the potential to impact on the 
acceptability of the data from these sites and from the study as a whole. In addition, the applicant had 
concluded that some of the issues have implications beyond the CRO used to monitor US sites, noting 
that the US sites together accounted for the majority of patients enrolled into the cSSTI studies but 
only one site contributing 27 patients participated in the CAP studies. Hence, the applicant had already 
acknowledged the need to provide reassurance that the data from all four studies (covering five 
continents and using several different CROs within each study) could be accepted. 
The plan proposed by the applicant to address the GCP inspection findings was accepted and the CHMP 
agreed to allow a prolonged 9-months clock stop to enable the actions to be completed and reported. 
The  applicant’s  main  focus  was  to  conduct  a  Source  Data  Verification  (SDV)  exercise  that  ultimately 
comprised  an  audit  of  >  80%  of  all  subjects  enrolled  into  the  four  Phase  3  studies.  Briefly,  the  SDV 
included: 
o  The  Forest/Cerexa  audit  programme,  which  had  taken  place  prior  to  the  ceftaroline  US  NDA 
filing in December 2009. These audits involved approximately 40% of the randomised patients 
for both cSSTI and CAP indications. 
o  The  AstraZeneca  audit  programme,  which  was  a  newly  conducted  SDV  programme  by 
independent auditors involving 34 cSSTI and 68 CAP investigator sites from November 2011 - 
March 2012. This included some sites that were audited by Forest/Cerexa.  
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 28/122
 
 
 
 
o  The  combined  total  number  of  patient  records  for  which  SDV  was  conducted  is  2127,  which 
represented 81.6% of patients randomised into the four Phase 3 studies. 
o  A  committee  was  convened  to  adjudicate  and  classify  SDV  findings  from  both  SDV 
programmes.  The  adjudication  committee  classified  efficacy  findings  as  either  critical 
(inconsistency  affecting  clinical  outcome  evaluation  of 
the  patient)  or  non-critical 
(inconsistency not affecting the clinical outcome evaluation of the patient).  
In the report on the SVD the following conclusions were reached: 
Monitoring  –  There  were  only  7/2127  (0.3%)  patients  reviewed  where  the  CSR  efficacy  data  for 
determining the clinical outcome could not be verified in the source records. The rate of critical findings 
did not exceed 1.2% in any study and the rate of non-critical findings was < 4%. The efficacy results 
were  very  robust  to  any  inconsistencies,  as  confirmed  by  sensitivity  analyses  restricted  to  those 
patients  who  had  data  reviewed.  The  SDV  findings  did  not  call  into  question  the  original  conclusions 
from the studies.  
Analysis  population  adjudication  process  -  The  applicant  identified  patients  that  were  excluded 
from the CE population owing to having received systemic antimicrobials during the excluded window. 
Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the inclusion or exclusion of these patients did not significantly 
affect the overall conclusions of the pivotal studies. In addition, the applicant identified organisms that 
were  inconsistently  classified  as  pathogens  or  non-pathogens  by  the  Evaluability  Committee  (EC). 
Sensitivity  analyses  were  reassuring  in  that  any  inconsistent  decisions  of  the  EC  did  not  have  a 
significant impact in the overall conclusions on efficacy in the pivotal studies. 
Blinding procedures - The applicant reviewed the blinded status of the site personnel and found that 
40  personnel  were  granted  inappropriate  unblinded  status.  However,  only  4/40  actually  accessed 
unblinded  data  and  all  patients  randomised  during  the  period  that  these  personnel  had  inappropriate 
access were already excluded from the analysis in the original MAA so these findings had no impact on 
the overall conclusions of the pivotal studies. 
Quality  control – The Applicant reviewed a high percentage of fDCFs for the pivotal studies and the 
error rate was found to be very low. The SDV adjudication committee found that these errors had no 
significant  impact  on  the  overall  conclusion  of  the  studies.  In  addition,  31205  non-CRF  assessments 
were reviewed and 118 (0.38%) were found to have dates other than the protocol visit dates. Of these 
118 assessments only 14 did not have documentation clarifying why they were conducted outside the 
protocol specified visit windows. Overall, the error rate for the non-CRF assessments was very low and 
within SOP targets. 
Investigational medicinal product (IMP) handling - The applicant identified the sites where there 
was  the  greatest  risk  of  degradation  of  vancomycin  occurring  following  reconstitution  and  before 
administration to the patient i.e. sites employing HHC were considered to be at greatest risk with sites 
employing  OPAT  or  with  off-site  pharmacies  were  considered  to  be  at  lesser  risk.  The  sensitivity 
analyses after excluding either HHC or OPAT using sites did not affect the conclusions regarding non-
inferiority. It should be noted that these sensitivity analyses are anyway based on a theoretical worst 
case scenario assuming that all HHC, OPAT and off-site pharmacy sites mishandled the transportation 
of vancomycin leading to degradation of the reconstituted product.  
CHMP discussion of the inspection and responses from the applicant 
The CHMP’s remaining concerns that the sponsor oversight and the overall levels of monitoring that 
occurred in the Phase 3 studies were not optimal were focused on the fact that the initial (Forest-
Cerexa) and the applicant’s additional audits had identified discrepancies that were scattered across a 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 29/122
 
 
 
 
range of study sites, indicating that there was an overall sub-optimal oversight of the studies by the 
CRO and sponsor.   
However, the CHMP acknowledged the findings of the applicant’s SDV exercise, including the high 
proportion of patient records audited (81.6%), which took 9 months to complete. Importantly, the 
CHMP noted the low level of critical and non-critical findings and it was considered that this exercise 
had to a large extent addressed the doubts raised in the GCP inspection report regarding the data 
integrity and the validity of the analyses as reported in the CSRs. The CHMP also noted that various 
sensitivity analyses had been conducted, several of which had excluded patients based on a worse 
case scenario situation, and even these had supported the initial primary analyses. 
The CHMP therefore concluded, following further discussion (including the reporting inspector) that the 
validity of the individual study databases and the analyses of safety and efficacy could be accepted.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
2.4.2.1.  Introduction 
The PK data are derived from 11 clinical pharmacology studies (phase 1 studies) after administration of 
ceftaroline fosamil by iv infusion or im injection in healthy volunteers and patients with different 
degrees of renal impairment and from subsets of patients enrolled in the phase 2 and 3 studies. In 
addition, in vitro studies were conducted to evaluate the protein binding, distribution into blood cells, 
and in vitro metabolism of ceftaroline, the inhibition and induction potential of ceftaroline on the 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system, as well as studies to determine if ceftaroline fosamil or 
ceftaroline are substrates or inhibitors of certain transporters. No in vivo drug-drug interaction (DDI) 
studies were performed.  
Data from the phase 1 studies were used along with PK data collected in phase 2 and 3 studies to 
develop population PK models for ceftaroline fosamil and ceftaroline. The final population PK model 
was then used in the analyses of the PK/PD target values, PK/PD relationships for antimicrobial efficacy, 
and the probability of target attainment for antimicrobial efficacy in patients with cSSTI and CAP. 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 34/122
 
 
 
 
 
 
PK profile 
The initial PK studies were a single dose (50 to 1000 mg) escalation study (P903-01)  and a multiple 
dose (300 or 600 mg twice daily for 14 days or 800 mg once daily for 7 days) escalation study. 
Ceftaroline fosamil was very rapidly converted to active ceftaroline after iv administration, which is the 
predominant circulating compound. PK for ceftaroline fosamil, ceftaroline and its inactive metabolite 
were linear over the dose range and duration tested.  Ceftaroline Cmax and AUC values increased 
approximately in proportion to increases in dose within the dose range of 50 mg to1000 mg, and no 
accumulation of ceftaroline fosamil or active ceftaroline was observed with twice dailymultiple-dose 
regimens. The Tmax for ceftaroline generally occurred near the end of the infusion, and the t½ of 
ceftaroline was 2-3 hours (2.60 ± 0.46 h in study P903-13). These results demonstrated time-
independent pharmacokinetics of ceftaroline. The PK of the inactive metabolite (ring opened form) was 
also independent of dose and duration of dosing over the ranges investigated.  
Additional data were obtained on administration of single 600 mg IV doses infused over 60 minutes, 
twice and thrice daily dosing of 600 mg and twice daily dosing of 900 mg (each over 10 days) in 
combination with the beta-lactamase inhibitor NXL104 (studyCXL-PK-01). After single 600 mg doses 
the mean Cmax ceftaroline was around 28,000 ng/ml and AUC 0-t was about 62,000 ng.h/ml. 
Corresponding values for ceftaroline M1 were about 3,800 ng/ml and 16,500 ng.h/ml. Dose-normalized 
Cmax and AUC0-24 for ceftaroline and ceftaroline M-1 were comparable across the dosing regimens in 
this study. 
Distribution and metabolism 
Following an iv infusion dose, the mean apparent volume of distribution of ceftaroline at steady-state 
(Vss) or at the terminal phase (Vz) in healthy volunteers ranged from 15.8 – 21.3 L, and 22 – 46 L, 
respectively (studies P903-01, -02, -11, -13, -18 and -20).  
The plasma protein binding of ceftaroline in vitro was generally low (approximately 20%, range 
14.5%-28%, bound) and concentration independent in human plasma over the clinically relevant 
concentration range (1 to 50 micrograms/mL).  
Ceftaroline and its metabolites are unable to effectively penetrate into red blood cells (mass balance 
study P903-13). The applicant clarified in its responses to the D120 CHMP list of questions that 
despite some in vitro data showing increase in CYP1A2 activity at higher concentrations of the inactive 
ceftaroline metabolite, in clinical settings the maximum achievable plasma concentration of the 
metabolite at steady state was approx. 10 times lower and that it was unlikely that any relevant effect 
on concomitantly administered CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. clozapine or theophylline) would be expected. 
This was agreed by the CHMP. 
Elimination 
40%-70% of the ceftaroline fosamil dose was excreted in the urine as ceftaroline (studies P903-01, 
P903-02, P903-04, P903-11, P903-13, P903-17, P903-18, and P903-20). Additionally, renal clearance 
of ceftaroline was generally independent of dose and approximately equal to or less than the 
glomerular filtration rate. Therefore, in conjuction with the in vitro results indicating little or no 
involvement of OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2, active renal transport is not considered to play a major role in 
renal excretion of ceftaroline.  
Following i.v. infusion of [14C] ceftaroline fosamil (Study P903-13), a mean of 87.5%±3.9% of the 
dose of total radioactivity was excreted in urine and 5.95%±2.93% was excreted in faeces through the 
last collection interval, confirming that urinary excretion is the principal route of elimination for 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 35/122
 
 
 
 
ceftaroline and its metabolites. Most of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the first 48 
hours (approx.90%). The overall mean recovery of radioactivity in urine and faeces was 93.4%±3.1% 
over the maximum collection period of 216 hours post-dose, with recovery in individual subjects 
ranging from 87.5% to 95.9%. The mean percent of dose excreted in urine as ceftaroline was 65.02 ± 
8.22. The mean percent of dose excreted in urine as ceftaroline M-1 was 5.66 ± 1.10%.  
In study CXL-PK-01 approximately 57% (47.0%-70.8%) of the dose of ceftaroline fosamil was 
excreted in urine as ceftaroline on Days 1 and 10 and this parameter appeared to be dose 
independent. Approximately 7% of the dose of ceftaroline fosamil was excreted in urine as ceftaroline 
M-1 on Day 1 and approximately 8% on Day 10, assuming that ceftaroline was completely metabolised 
to ceftaroline M-1. Renal clearance for ceftaroline M-1 also appeared to be dose independent. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
The PK for ceftaroline fosamil, ceftraroline and its inactive metabolite were linear over the dose range 
(single doses 50-1000 mg) and dosing duration (300-600 mg twice dailyfor 14 days) tested (study 
P903-01). Cmax and AUC increased proportionately with dose and were independent of dose duration. 
Further data (study P903-20) showed dose-proportionality for single doses of 1500-2000 mg.  
Time dependency 
Observed t½ is relatively short and there was no appreciable accumulation during multiple dosing with 
60-minute infusions of 300 mg and 600 mg twice dailyor 800 mg once daily(study P903-01). There 
was also no accumulation on dosing with 600 mg thrice dailyor 600 mg twice dailyfollowing 5 days of 
i.m.dosing (study P903-017).  
The estimates of CL and t½ of ceftaroline were generally independent of dose duration and frequency. 
The mean±SD ceftaroline plasma concentration-time courses following the first and last 
administrations in P903-01 were generally comparable. These results demonstrated time-independent 
pharmacokinetics of ceftaroline (study P903-01). 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
Ceftaroline is predominately eliminated by the kidney and the PK of ceftaroline has been studied in 
subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment (studies P903-02, P903-04 and P903-018). 
The PK parameters of ceftaroline were altered in subjects with mild (50mL/min<CrCL≤80 mL/min), 
moderate (30mL/min<CrCL≤50 mL/min), or severe (CrCL<30mL/min) renal impairment compared 
with subjects with normal renal function (CrCL>80 mL/min). The mean t½ of ceftaroline was increased 
by 28% and 60% in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment from an average of 2.87±0.43 
hours in subjects with normal renal function. Systemic exposure (AUC) to ceftaroline increased by 22% 
and 52% in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal 
function. Ceftaroline renal clearance decreased significantly in subjects with mild and moderate renal 
impairment by 44% and 64%, respectively; however, Cmax was approximately unaltered in these 
subjects. In subjects with severe renal impairment, t½ was longer and the systemic exposure was 
enhanced (after a single IV dose of 400 mg ceftaroline fosamil over 60 minutes, mean values for 
ceftaroline AUC were 123% greater and Cmax was similar in subjects with severe renal impairment 
than in subjects with normal renal function. The mean t½ of ceftaroline in subjects with severe renal 
impairment was 5.05±1.22 hours compared with 2.87±0.43 hours in subjects with normal renal 
function). 
Zinforo 
Assessment report

The PK of ceftaroline was also evaluated in subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving 
intermittent haemodialysis (study P903-18). The results showed that the Cmax for ceftaroline in 
subjects with ESRD was relatively unchanged compared with the Cmax in subjects with normal renal 
function, while the AUC was increased by 82%. In subjects with ESRD who received ceftaroline fosamil 
after the end of haemodialysis, the Cmax for ceftaroline was 53% higher and the AUC was 123% 
higher than in subjects with normal renal function. The t½ of ceftaroline was significantly longer, 113% 
and 115%, respectively, in subjects with ESRD who received ceftaroline fosamil before or after 
haemodialysis compared with the t½ in subjects with normal renal function. When haemodialysis was 
started 4 hours after dosing, about 22% of the administered dose of ceftaroline was removed. High 
plasma levels of ceftaroline fosamil observed in subjects with ESRD during i.v. infusion may be due to 
the same arm being used for PK sampling and i.v. infusion, as the other arm was reserved for the 
haemodialysis procedure. The impact of blood sampling from the arm used for infusion on the PK of 
ceftaroline is unknown, although the PK parameters of ceftaroline are similar to those of patients with 
severe renal impairment. There is insufficient information to make specific dosage adjustment 
recommendations for patients with severe renal impairment and ESRD, including patients undergoing 
haemodialysis. 
The recommendations for dosing in mild and moderate renal impairment in the phase 3 studies and in 
the SmPC also took into account PK/PD simulations. It was concluded that no dose adjustment was 
needed (and thus the probability of target attainmentshould be better than for those with normal renal 
function due to the prolonged t1/2). 
Monte-Carlo simulations predicted that subjects with severe renal impairment would have AUCs 
~100% higher vs. normal renal function and that 300 mg administered twice dailymight be an 
appropriate dose but such subjects were excluded from clinical studies and so there is no experience 
that could be used to validate this prediction. At CHMP request the applicant included a plan to obtain 
the missing data which would support a dose recommendation for patients with CrCl< 30 mL/min in 
the RMP. 
Impaired hepatic function 
The effect of impaired hepatic function has not been studied given the lack of evidence of metabolism 
of ceftaroline and the renal route of excretion. 
Gender  
The PK of ceftaroline were similar in male and female subjects (study P903-11), although there was a 
trend toward a slightly higher mean AUC0-∞ (6% to 15%) and Cmax (approx. 17%) in female subjects 
in both age groups. When ceftaroline clearance (CL) was normalized by body weight (BW), mean 
values of CL/BW in elderly female and male subjects were within 5% of each other, while mean CL/BW 
was about 19% higher in young female subjects than in young male subjects. Dosage adjustment 
based on gender is not necessary. 
Elderly 
Study P903-011 compared PK profiles between healthy elderly subjects (16 aged ≥ 65 years; including 
8 aged ≥ 75 years) and healthy young adult subjects (16 aged 18 to 45 years) following a single dose 
of 600 mg. The mean CrCl in the elderly subjects in this study was 79.3 ml/min and that for the young 
adults was 129.95 ml/min. Mean Cmax for ceftaroline was unchanged in elderly subjects but the AUC 
increased by 33%, which was associated with slower clearance, especially slower renal clearance, vs. 
young adult subjects. There was a corresponding 41% increase in terminal t½ of ceftaroline in the 
elderly. An exploratory analysis using linear regression gave negative slopes for AUC0-∞, Cmax and 
t½ vs. CrCl whereas CL, CLr and Ae0-t were positively correlated with CrCl. The correlations between 
AUC0-∞, Ae0-t and CrCl were not significant but a statistically significant relationship was detected 
between t½, CL, CLr and CrCl in healthy elderly and young adult subjects. The Cmax and AUC for 
Zinforo

Page 37/122
 
 
 
 
ceftaroline fosamil were both 12% higher in the elderly while the terminal t½ was unchanged. Cmax 
for ceftaroline M-1 was 11% higher in the elderly and the AUC increased by 48%. Higher systemic 
exposure to ceftaroline M-1 was associated with reduced renal and overall clearance and the 24% 
increase in terminal t½.  Additional modelling indicated that CrCl was a significant factor for increases 
in ceftaroline and ceftaroline M-1 systemic exposure in elderly subjects while age alone did not explain 
the increases observed.  
Children 
The PK of ceftaroline were evaluated in adolescent subjects aged 12 to 17 years who were hospitalized 
and receiving antibiotic therapy other than ceftaroline (Study P903-15). P903-15 evaluated PK 
ceftaroline in nine adolescent subjects aged from 12 to 16 years while being hospitalised and treated 
with licensed antibacterial agents for infections of any type. Mean BMI was 21.51 kg/m2, mean CrCl 
was 156.84 mL/minute and actual doses were from 320 to 600 mg. The mean Cmax and AUC0-∞ for 
ceftaroline were about 10% and 23% less than the values observed in adult subjects following a 600 
mg dose. After exclusion of one subject with unusual PK ceftaroline the mean Cmax for ceftaroline M-1 
was ~ 7% Cmax ceftaroline and the mean AUC0-∞ was ~ 19% of the AUC0-∞ ceftaroline. Ceftaroline 
fosamil was rapidly converted to ceftaroline and was generally only measurable in plasma for 0.25 to 1 
h after the end of study drug infusion. The mean Cmax was ~ 22% of that for ceftaroline and the 
mean AUC0-t was ~ 6%. Ceftaroline fosamil was not measurable in any urine samples. The CHMP 
agreed that the data in this study are confined to nine subjects aged from 12 to 17 years who received 
a single dose of 8 mg/kg if < 75 kg or 600 mg if ≥75 kg while being hospitalised and treated with 
licensed antibacterial agents for infections of any type and are therefore too limited to be reflected in 
the SmPC. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
The non-clinical studies indicated: 
  no inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP) (CYP1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, 2E1 & 3A4) in vitro by ceftaroline and ceftaroline fosamil 
  no induction of CYP450 isozymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, & CYP3A4/5) 
in vitro by ceftaroline, ceftaroline fosamil and ceftaroline M-1 
 
ceftaroline is not a substrate or inhibitor of human active renal uptake transporters (OCT2, 
OAT1 or OAT3), indicating that active tubular secretion of ceftaroline does not contribute 
significantly to its renal elimination and that ceftaroline is unlikely to inhibit elimination of 
drugs that are actively secreted in urine by these transporters 
 
ceftaroline is not a substrate of P-gp or BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein; ABCG2, which 
is an important efflux transporter) or an inhibitor of P-gp but it is a weak inhibitor of BCRP. 
In vivo 
Based on the non-clinical findings no drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. The applicant 
commissioned a review of the data base to explore the impact of concomitant medications on PK. The 
report considered concomitant medication and PK data from 220 subjects treated with ceftaroline for 
cSSSI or CAP included in the population PK analyses. Pertinent findings were: 
 
Inducers or substrates of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes did not alter ceftaroline AUC0-12 or 
Cmax.  
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 38/122
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Use of CYP1A2 inhibitors (p = 0.018) or CYP3A4/5/7 inhibitors (p = 0.005) gave statistically 
significantly higher ceftaroline AUC0-12 values vs. non-use with increases in median AUC0-12 
values of 19.0% and 20.3%, respectively. 
  Use of vasodilators or anionic drugs known to undergo active renal tubular secretion gave 
statistically significantly higher AUC0-12 values (p ≤ 0.001) vs. non-use with increases in 
AUC0-12 of 16.6% and 17.6%, respectively. 
Population PK model 
Samples for population PK analyses were obtained from subjects in both treatment groups in phase 2 
and 3 studies using a sparse PK sampling schedule on day 3 at selected investigational sites.  
 
In the cSSTI study 06 the mean (± SD) trough concentration was 0.53 ± 0.69 μg/mL (n = 29). 
The mean concentration in samples collected within five minutes of the end of infusion was 
15.4 ± 6.68 μg/mL (n = 31). In study 07 the mean (± SD) trough concentration was 0.299 ± 
0.505 μg/mL. The mean concentration in samples collected within five minutes of the end of 
infusion was 15.2 ± 8.43 μg/mL (n = 13). 
 
In the CAP study 08 the mean (± SD) trough concentration was 1.30 ± 4.28 μg/mL (n=63). 
The mean concentration in samples collected within five minutes of the end of infusion was 
20.8 ± 7.74 μg/mL (n=63). In study 09 the mean (± SD) trough concentration was 1.30 ± 
2.73 μg/mL (n=73). The mean concentration in samples collected within five minutes of the 
end of infusion was 21.47 ± 12.35 μg/mL (n=31). 
A preliminary 2-compartment model with first-order input (conversion of ceftaroline fosamil to 
ceftaroline) and both first-order and Michaelis-Menten elimination best characterised the plasma 
concentrations of ceftaroline in subjects in initial phase 1 studies. The model demonstrated that CrCL 
was the primary factor predicting clearance of ceftaroline. The effects of dose and sex on CL and the 
effect of body weight on the volume of distribution Vd of the central and peripheral compartments were 
also statistically significant.  
The final population PK models for ceftaroline fosamil and ceftaroline were based on the phase 1 and 
cSSTI studies. Subsequently the final model was fit to data from the CAP studies. The model 
accommodated the phase 3 CAP data showing a relatively unbiased fit. Therefore results were used to 
predict ceftaroline exposure for PK/PD target, PK/PD modelling and PTA analyses for subjects with 
either cSSTI or CAP. 
A 3-compartment model with zero-order input and first-order elimination, parameterised using 
clearance and volume, best characterised the plasma concentration-time data for ceftaroline fosamil.  
The population mean clearance and central volume of distribution of ceftaroline fosamil were estimated 
to be 228 L/h and 10.8 L, respectively, thus indicating a fairly rapid first-order conversion rate to 
ceftaroline (21.1 h-1). CrCL was identified as a statistically significant predictor of ceftaroline fosamil 
clearance and volume of distribution but conversion to ceftaroline still occurred rapidly in subjects with 
renal insufficiency. 
In the PK model for ceftaroline all relevant PK parameters for ceftaroline were conditioned on the 
fraction of ceftaroline fosamil converted to ceftaroline. A 2-compartment model with first-order input 
(conversion to ceftaroline) and both first-order and Michaelis-Menten elimination best characterised the 
plasma concentrations of ceftaroline in phase 1 and phase 2/3 subjects. To assess the extent of the 
observed dose non-linearity of ceftaroline and its possible impact on the therapeutic dose range, the 
final ceftaroline PK model (without the M-M elimination component) was fitted to subjects in the limited 
dose range 250-1000 mg and compared with the full model (with the M-M elimination component fitted 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 39/122
 
 
 
 
to the same subjects). Both models (linear and nonlinear) presented similar fits to the observed data 
in the dose range of 250 to 1000 mg, with fits in the therapeutic dose range of 400 and 600 mg twice 
daily being comparable. Non-linearity was more apparent at the highest doses. The population mean 
linear clearance (CLlin), likely representing renal clearance of ceftaroline, and intrinsic clearance (CLi) 
were estimated to be 3.94 L/h and 14.7 L/h, respectively. The steady-state volume of distribution of 
ceftaroline was determined to be 26 L, indicating that distribution is mostly in extracellular water.  
The final population PK model identified a number of covariates affecting ceftaroline PK:  
(1) CrCL was the most statistically significant predictor of linear and intrinsic clearance of ceftaroline, 
both of which decreased with decreasing renal function. For subjects aged 30 years the AUC0-12 
was predicted to increase 1.15- to 1.34-fold with mild renal impairment, 1.34- to 1.58-fold with 
moderate renal impairment and 1.58- to 1.98-fold with severe renal impairment relative to 
subjects with normal renal function at a dose of 600 mg, suggesting that dosage adjustment might 
be necessary for subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment. The applicant considered that 
there was insufficient information to make specific dosage adjustment recommendations for severe 
renal impairment and ESRD, including haemodialysis and such subjects were not enrolled into 
phase 3 studies.  
(2)  Ceftaroline intrinsic clearance decreased with age. After inclusion of the CrCL effect in the model, 
age was still found to have a statistically significant effect on the overall disposition of ceftaroline. 
The age effect was more pronounced for those with severely impaired renal function. In subjects 
aged 65 years vs. those aged 30 years with normal renal function a 1.17- to 1.20-fold increase in 
steady-state AUC0-12 was predicted at a dose of 600 mg. Similarly a 1.30- to 1.42-fold increase in 
steady-state AUC0-12 was predicted for subjects aged > 65 years vs. those aged 30 years with 
severely impaired renal function at a dose of 400 mg. The predicted steady-state AUC0-12 in a 65-
year-old subject with severe renal impairment dosed with 400 mg ceftaroline fosamil was 
comparable to that for a 65-year-old subject with mild renal impairment dosed with 600 mg. 
However, in the datasets used to build the model only 4 subjects aged > 65 years had moderate 
renal impairment and only 3 had severe renal impairment. Thus, even though an increase of 42% 
in AUC0-12 is predicted for a 65-year-old subject with a CrCL of 15 mL/min vs. a 30-year-old 
subject at a dose of 400 mg, the overall influence of age was not thought to warrant dosage 
adjustment beyond that recommended for renal impairment. Steady-state Cmax values were not 
affected by changes in age. 
(3) A statistically significant increase in intrinsic clearance and central volume of distribution (1.36- 
and 1.81-fold, respectively) was estimated for subjects with cSSTI or CAP relative to phase 1 
subjects. 
(4)  Distribution clearance and peripheral volume of distribution were increased for males relative to 
females. A minor increase in ceftaroline Cmax (≈9% to 11%) and AUC0-12 (≈3%) for female 
subjects compared with male subjects at a dose of 600 mg was not considered to be of clinical 
significance.  
The population PK analysis identified significant increases in ceftaroline clearance and volume of 
distribution of the central compartment in patients with cSSTI compared with healthy volunteers. The 
predicted magnitude of decrease in ceftaroline exposure (Cmax and AUC) in patients with cSSTI or CAP 
was approximately 20%, which the applicant considered to be not clinically significant.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of ceftaroline is that of all beta-lactam agents: via inhibition of peptidoglycan 
synthesis.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
In-vitro activity by genus/species 
The spectrum of activity of ceftaroline includes many or most staphylococci, beta-haemolytic 
streptococci, Haemophilus and Moraxella spp., P. multocida and enterobacterial species. Ceftaroline is 
not active against non-fermenting Gram-negative rods including Acinetobacter spp. and activity 
against anaerobes is genus- or species-specific.  
An inoculum effect was present on in vitro testing with several species expressing one or more beta-
lactamases that can hydrolyse cephalosporins. Ceftaroline may be readily hydrolysed by, and is 
therefore mostly inactive against, organisms that produce ESBLs (including, among others, TEM and 
SHV lineages), AmpC enzymes or carbapenemases (serine-based and metallo-enzymes).  
Most S. aureus are inhibited by 0.25-0.5 mg/L but there is an upward shift in MICs against MRSA with 
MIC90 at 1-2 mg/L and occasional isolates with MICs of 4-8 mg/L. The highest MIC observed from the 
Phase 3 clinical studies was 2 mg/L. Most other staphylococcal species, including MRSE, show MIC90 
values of 1-2 mg/L but S. lugdunensis appears more susceptible (MIC90 0.12 mg/L). The surveillance 
data suggest an ECOFF for S. aureus at 1 or more likely 2 mg/L. However, PK/PD analyses suggest 
that a MIC of 2mg/L may not be adequately covered by dosing at 600 mg twice daily using 1-h 
infusions. 
For S. pneumoniae the MIC90 values are around 0.12 mg/L but with a shift up from the fully penicillin-
susceptible population (MIC90 0.015 mg/L) to non-susceptible (including penicillin-resistant) strains 
(MIC90 0.25-0.5 mg/L; regardless of serotype). Very few isolates required up to 2 mg/L for inhibition. 
In the phase 3 studies all pneumococci were inhibited at 0.12 mg and most at < 0.015 mg/L. 
The beta-haemolytic streptococcal species included in surveillance studies and isolated during the 
phase 2/3 studies were all inhibited by very low concentrations of ceftaroline (MIC90 values < 0.06 
mg/L and MICs that did not exceed 0.12 mg/L). Against viridans group streptococci, including those 
resistant to penicillin, the highest MIC was 1 mg/L and the MIC90 was 0.25 mg/L. As for other 
cephalosporins, ceftaroline cannot be considered active against enterococci (MIC90 values at least 4-8 
mg/L). 
Against E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and other enterobacteria (including Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. 
and P. mirabilis) not over-expressing beta-lactamases or manufacturing enzymes able to readily 
hydrolyse ceftaroline the MICs are mostly < 2 mg/L. However, the MIC90s for Morganella morganii, P. 
vulgaris and Serratia marcescens were all 16 mg/L or higher and these species cannot be considered to 
fall into the spectrum of activity of ceftaroline. MIC90 values from surveillance studies are highly 
variable depending on the rates and types of beta-lactamases produced in individual collections of 
organisms.  
Isolates of enterobacteria that could be considered within the spectrum of activity of ceftaroline 
showed that ceftazidime-resistant bacteria usually required at least 16 mg/L ceftaroline for inhibition. 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 41/122
 
 
 
 
 
However, these isolates were in the minority and there was a large separation evident between the 
susceptible population (MICs usually 0.5 mg/L or less) and the resistant population (16 mg/L or more).  
Haemophilus influenzae is inhibited with MIC90 0.12 mg/L and mostly by 0.06 mg/L ceftaroline. The 
highest MICs are often observed for beta-lactamase producers (in this species the enzyme is almost 
always TEM-1) and isolates with reduced susceptibility to ampicillin due to altered PBPs. The highest 
MIC observed in Phase 3 studies was 0.5 mg/L. Similarly, M. catarrhalis appears susceptible to 
ceftaroline with MIC90 estimated at 0.25 mg/L overall and only occasional isolates with MICs 0.5 to 1 
mg/L. In addition, P. multocida is usually inhibited by 0.06 mg/L. 
Among the anaerobes, ceftaroline appears likely to be active against Porphyromonas asaccharolytica 
and several Fusobacteria spp. and Veillonella spp. The Gram-positive anaerobes are more likely to be 
susceptible, including most Peptostreptococcus spp. and Eubacterium spp. whereas clostridial species 
(including C. perfringens) appear to have higher MICs and MIC90 values of around 4-8 mg/L. 
 Ceftaroline is not active against Mycoplasma or against intracellular Chlamydia or Legionella.  
PBP-binding studies and activity against well-characterised strains 
Competition binding assays have been performed for S. aureus and S. pneumoniae including strains 
that demonstrate PBP-mediated reduced susceptibility to penicillins (studies NSR-P0903-M-024, NSR-
P0903-M-041, P0903-M-004-011, TAK-599-00055 and TAK-599-00023).  
Against 50 MRSA consisting of well-characterised resistance phenotypes and genotypes from various 
geographical locations the highest ceftaroline MIC values (2 to 4 mg/L) were observed among strains 
with SCCmec type I with a rank order of susceptibility according to SCCmec type of IV > II > III and I. 
The ceftaroline IC50 for binding to PBP2a (as expressed by the majority of MRSA) was 0.16 mg/L 
(MRSA strain 67-0).  Ceftaroline binds equally well to PBPs 1, 2 and 3 of MSSA.  
Ceftaroline was very active in vitro against a range of S. pneumoniae strains (up to penicillin MICs ≥ 8 
mg/L). The activity of ceftaroline against 11 prevailing serotypes of S. pneumoniae ranged from 
≤0.008 - 0.25 mg/L, with an overall MIC90 of 0.12 mg/L.  IC50 values for PBP1a and PBP2x/2a/2b of 
the pneumococcal strain 2039 were lower for ceftaroline than for penicillin or ceftriaxone (study NSR-
P0903-M-024).  
The effect of ceftaroline on purified transpeptidases from S. pneumoniae PBP2X was monitored based 
on its ability to competitively inhibit hydrolysis of a thioester reporter substrate (S2d) by PBP2X 
derived from a penicillin-susceptible strain (R6) and a penicillin-resistant strain 5204 (study NSR-
P0903-M-026). Against PBP2X derived from R6, inhibition was extremely efficient.  
Stability to beta-lactamases from Gram-negative bacteria 
The in vitro activity of ceftaroline against a collection of molecularly characterised ESBL, AmpC and 
KPC isolates was low with MIC90 ≥ 128 (study NSR-CXL-M-002). 
The kinetics of ceftaroline hydrolysis in the presence of various ESBL and cephalosporinase enzymes 
was determined; all the β-lactamases tested were able to hydrolyse ceftaroline.  
Ceftaroline was generally less susceptible to hydrolysis than benzylpenicillin and was much less stable 
to hydrolysis than cefepime. Other types of beta-lactamases were not tested(e.g. M. catarrhalis beta-
lactamases BRO-1 and 2). 
Ceftaroline is a weak inducer of AmpC production and therefore it has comparable in-vitro activity 
against AmpC-inducible Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Serratia 
marcescens, P. vulgaris and P. aeruginosa strains as compared to isogenic AmpC-basal (i.e. deficient) 
Zinforo

mutant derivatives. However, AmpC-derepressed (high-level constitutive) mutants are resistant to 
ceftaroline. 
Bactericidal activity 
Ceftaroline demonstrated time-dependent killing. Maximum rates of killing were generally observed at 
≥ 2 x MIC. Bactericidal effects occurred within 8 to 24 hours.  
Post-antibiotic effect (PAE) 
PAEs determined in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model (defined as time to 1-log10 increase 
after decrease in free-drug serum concentration to < MIC minus time to same increase in untreated 
controls) gave short to modest PAEs with S. pneumoniae or E. coli. PAEs for S. aureus were in the 
range 0.8 to 7.2 h and for MRSA 3.8 to 4.8 h but there was no PAE against highly penicillin-resistant 
pneumococci.  
Secondary pharmacology 
Effects on cardiac conduction 
P903-05 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period crossover study (minimum 
5-day washout) in which 54 subjects (27 per gender) received ceftaroline fosamil (1500 mg 
administered over 60 minutes), placebo (infusion of saline) and i.v.moxifloxacin (400 mg over 60 
minutes) to determine the effect of ceftaroline on the ECG, including the QTc interval.  
Mean Cmax ceftaroline was 3.9 times and mean AUC0-∞ was 3.7 times the mean AUC0-τ observed in 
P903-01 on the last day of dosing with 600 mg twice dailyfor 14 days. In addition, Cmax was 4.6 times 
and AUC0-∞ was 1.8 times the corresponding mean values observed in P903-04 in subjects with 
severe renal impairment who received a 400 mg dose. Higher exposures were also documented for 
ceftaroline fosamil and the M-1 metabolite. There is no clinically meaningful QTcIb interval 
prolongation due to a supra-therapeutic dose of ceftaroline. 
Effects on gut flora 
In P903-14 there were no measurable concentrations of ceftaroline detected with the bioassay in any 
faecal samples collected. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Ceftaroline renal clearance approximates to the glomerular filtration rate and it is not a substrate or 
inhibitor of human active renal uptake transporters, which supports a conclusion that active secretion 
in the tubules does not contribute significantly to elimination. The low protein binding and the in vitro 
studies with P-gp and human cytochromes as well as the exploration of the clinical database all 
suggest a low risk of drug-drug interactions.   
The applicant has not made any recommendations for dose adjustment in severe renal impairment and 
ESRD. There are insufficient data from infected subjects to assist in this matter and the applicant 
considers that there are insufficient data to underpin reliable modelling. The applicant shall perform a 
further study in subjects with severe renal insufficiency to support specific dose recommendations (see 
table 31).

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of ceftaroline is straightforward, as per the above.  A series of method 
validation, Pk profile, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies 
have been conducted and are considered to be adequate by CHMP. There is metabolism by opening of 
the β-lactam ring to form ceftaroline M-1 with 3 additional minor unidentified 
metabolites/chromatographic peaks detected. These additional minor metabolites were observed in 
human plasma and excreta and were seen in the rat and monkey.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
There were two phase 2 studies in cSSTI and four phase 3 studies, including two in each indication 
sought (i.e. cSSTI and CAP). The phase 2 study -19 evaluated only i.m ceftaroline, while all other 
studies employed intravenous infusions of 600 mg twice daily over 60 minutes.

This was a multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded comparative safety and efficacy study of iv 
ceftaroline versus iv vancomycin with or without adjunctive iv aztreonam for 7 to 14 days. One 
hundred patients were randomised (ceftaroline to comparator ratio: 2 to 1) in the study. The dose of 
ceftaroline fosamil was 600 mg over 60 minutes q12h. The active comparator regimen was iv 
vancomycin 1 g over 60 minutes q12h, initially then either continued or shifted to a PRP, with or 
without adjunctive iv aztreonam 1 g over 30 minutes every 8 hours (q8h). The primary outcome 
measure was the clinical response at TOC, which was defined as 7 days to 20 days after EOT.  
Of 100 patients enrolled, 88 were CE (61 in the ceftaroline group and 27 in the vancomycin plus 
aztreonam group) and 63 were ME (42 in the ceftaroline group and 21 in the vancomycin plus 
aztreonam group).  
In patients with cSSTI, ceftaroline therapy resulted in a clinical cure rate that was numerically greater 
than that of the vancomycin plus aztreonam regimen for both the co-primary cMITT population: 88.1% 
(59/67) vs 81.3% (26/32) and the CE population (cMITT patients with an outcome assessment):  
96.7% (59/61) vs 88.9% (24/27).  Microbiological success rates were consistent with the clinical 
success rates. Ceftaroline therapy resulted in a high microbiological success rate that was numerically 
greater than that of the vancomycin plus aztreonam regimen for both the mMITT population (cMITT 
patients with ≥1 baseline pathogen, 84.3%, 43/51 vs 77.8%, 21/27) and the ME population (CE 
patients with ≥1 susceptible pathogen, 95.2%, 40/42 vs 85.7%, 18/21). 
Study P903-19 
This was a multicentre, randomised, open-label, comparative efficacy and safety study of 
intramuscular (im) ceftaroline versus iv linezolid for 5 to 14 days in adult patients with cSSTI. A total 
of 150 patients were randomised (ceftaroline to comparator ratio: 2 to 1) in the study. The dose of im 
ceftaroline fosamil was 600 mg q12h. The comparator regimen was iv linezolid 600 mg over 60 
minutes q12h with or without adjunctive iv aztreonam 1 g over 60 minutes q12h. The primary outcome 
measure was the clinical response at TOC, which was defined as 8 days to 15 days after EOT.  
Of 150 patients enrolled, 125 were CE (86 in the ceftaroline group and 39 in the linezolid plus 
aztreonam group) and 96 were ME (63 in the ceftaroline group and 33 in the linezolid plus aztreonam 
group). The clinical cure rates in ceftaroline and linezolid plus aztreonam groups at TOC after the final 
dose of study drug for the CE population were 90.7% (78/86) vs 97.4% (38/39) and for the MITT 
population were 84.7% (83/98) vs 88.9% (40/45). Cure rates were lower for ceftaroline in both 
populations, but the confidence intervals (CIs) for the 2 treatment groups overlapped. 
The dose selection for the phase 3 programme was based on Monte Carlo simulations employing a 
preliminary population PK model and from murine thigh and lung infection models that suggested that 
the median free drug %T>MIC to achieve 1-log kill was 44% for S. pneumoniae and for (susceptible) 
enterobacteria compared to 36% for S. aureus. The corresponding median values needed to achieve 2-
log kill were 51%, 54% and 51%, respectively. Simulations predicted that 600 mg ceftaroline fosamil 
infused over 60 minutes twice daily (q12h) in subjects with normal renal function would provide a 
mean free drug %T > MIC of ~51%. This regimen was predicted to give a PTA of 90% for %T >MIC 
40% at MIC 2 mg/L.   
The PK/PD analyses for enterobacteria were revised during the assessment period. The mean free drug 
(f) %T>MIC values applicable to susceptible enterobacteria were re-calculated. Revised estimates of f 
%T>MIC for ceftaroline required for stasis (45%, 47% and 48.5% for geometric mean, arithmetic 
mean and median, respectively) and 1 log kill (64%, 69%, 73% for geometric mean, arithmetic mean 
and median, respectively) are slightly higher than those previously observed with other cephalosporins 
against enterobacteria.

A final population PK model was developed to allow estimates of exposure in the phase two cSSTI and 
phase three cSSTI and CAP studies and the dose selected for the phase 3 programme was supported 
by the final model based on Monte Carlo simulations. 
2.5.2.  Main studies  
The four phase 3 studies were double blind with respect to the investigators and the study participants. 
For the purposes of drawing up appropriate solutions and achieving appropriate dose adjustments 
there were designated study personnel at each site who were unblinded to the treatment assignment. 
Solutions were enclosed in yellow bags to otherwise maintain the blind.  
Study P903-06 in cSSTI: A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparative 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ceftaroline versus vancomycin plus aztreonam in 
adult subjects with complicated skin and skin structure infection 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The study was conducted between February and November 2007 in 55 centers from 10 countries 
(Europe, Latin America and the US).  
The demographic and baseline characteristics between treatment groups were similar. Subjects were 
predominately male (63%), non-Hispanic (77%), white (75%), and had a mean age of 48 years. 
Relevant medical and surgical histories were comparable between treatment groups for recent trauma 
(25%), diabetes mellitus (19%), previous skin infection (14%), and PVD (14%). Infection sizes 
(lengths, widths, areas) were similar in both treatment group and indicative of severe infections with a 
median area of 180 cm2 and a mean area of 315 cm2 for all subjects. 
Important inclusion criteria 
Eligible adults were to have infections that met either of the following criteria: 
 
Involved deeper soft tissue or required significant surgical intervention such as a wound infection 
(surgical or traumatic), a major abscess, an infected ulcer or deep and extensive cellulitis: 
o  Deeper soft tissue was defined as sub-dermal tissue 
o  Significant surgical intervention was defined as a major operative procedure 
o  Wound infection was defined by the presence of either purulent or seropurulent discharge 
from a surgical/traumatic wound or ≥ 5 cm erythema surrounding the wound margin with 
onset within 7 days before randomisation and within 30 days of incurring the wound 
o  Abscess was defined by the presence of a loculated fluid collection with ≥ 2 cm erythema 
and onset within 7 days before randomisation  
o  Cellulitis was defined by the presence of advancing erythema, oedema, and heat with 
onset within 7 days before randomisation. Deep and extensive cellulitis had a surface area 
≥ 10 cm2 
OR 
  Cellulitis or abscess of a lower extremity in subjects with diabetes mellitus or well documented 
peripheral vascular disease (PVD). In this regard: 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 46/122
 
 
 
 
 
o  Eligible diabetics had to be on specific treatment  
o  Well documented PVD was defined as arterial or venous 
o  vascular disease resulting in ischemia of the lower extremity as manifest by ulceration, 
poor wound healing, 
o  or the absence of readily palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. For the purpose 
of this study, 
o  PVD did not include microvascular or lymphatic drainage abnormalities 
In addition, they were to have ≥ 3 of the following: purulent or seropurulent drainage or discharge, 
erythema, fluctuance, heat or localised warmth, pain or tenderness to palpation, fever > 38ºC oral (> 
38.5ºC rectal or tympanic) or hypothermia (< 35ºC), WBC > 10,000/mm3, > 10% immature 
neutrophils (bands) irrespective of WBC count. Subjects were to be in need of hospitalisation or ER 
treatment except that subjects suitable for OPAT could be enrolled if they met pre-specified conditions 
and had infections expected to require at least 5 days of IV antimicrobial therapy. 
Important exclusion criteria: 
o  More than 24 h systemic treatment with an antimicrobial expected to be effective for cSSTI 
within 96 h of randomisation unless subjects had failed after at least 48 h of treatment and had 
microbiological evidence of failure (positive Gram’s stain and/or culture of an organism 
resistant in vitro to the prior therapy 
o  Failure of vancomycin or aztreonam or isolation of an organism resistant in vitro to vancomycin 
or aztreonam 
o  SSTI known or suspected to be due to anaerobes, fungi, parasites or viruses and infections at 
least partly due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, involving decubitus or diabetic foot ulcer or an 
ulcer associated with PVD accompanied by osteomyelitis and likely to require surgical 
intervention within 60 days 
o  Need for significant surgical intervention that could not be performed < 48 h post-
randomisation 
o  Any infection associated with a third-degree burn or burn covering > 5% of total BSA, 
underlying inflammatory skin disease, human or animal bites, rapidly necrotizing processes, 
gangrene, prosthetic materials that were not to be removed, known or suspected endocarditis, 
osteomyelitis or septic arthritis 
o  Severe renal insufficiency (CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min) 
Treatments 
Ceftaroline fosamil 600 mg was administered IV over 60 minutes every 12 h. The dose was adjusted 
to 400 mg in case of moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl >30 and up to 50 ml/min). The comparator 
was vancomycin 1 g administered over 60 minutes every 12 hours plus (followed by) aztreonam 1 g 
administered over 60 minutes every 12 hours. The vancomycin dose could be adjusted according to 
body weight. The duration of therapy was from 5-14 days with up to 21 days allowed (sponsor 
approval for individual subjects). 
Objectives 
Primary:

To determine the noninferiority (using a pre-specified 10% margin) in clinical cure rate of ceftaroline 
treatment compared with that of vancomycin plus aztreonam treatment at the test of cure (TOC) visit 
in clinically evaluable (CE) and modified intent-to-treat (MITT) populations of adult subjects with a 
complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI). Cure required resolution of all signs and 
symptoms or improvement such that no further antimicrobial therapy was considered to be necessary. 
In the final SAP the TOC visit window was defined as 7-20 days post-therapy and the LFU visit window 
was set to occur between 21-45 days post-therapy. 
Secondary: 
1. To evaluate the microbiological success rate at the TOC visit 
2. To evaluate the clinical response at the end of therapy (EOT) visit 
3. To evaluate the clinical and microbiological response by pathogen at the TOC visit 
4. To evaluate clinical relapse at the late follow-up (LFU) visit 
5. To evaluate microbiological reinfection or recurrence at the LFU Visit 
6. To evaluate safety 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The coprimary efficacy outcome measures were the per-subject clinical cure rate at the TOC visit in the 
CE and MITT Populations. Subjects were considered clinically cured at the TOC Visit if they had total 
resolution of all signs and symptoms of the baseline infection, or improvement of the infection such 
that no further antimicrobial therapy was necessary. 
The secondary efficacy outcome measures were: 
 
 
 
Per-subject clinical cure rate at the TOC visit in the cMITT population 
Per-subject clinical cure rate at the EOT visit in the MITT, cMITT, and CE populations 
Per-subject microbiological response at the TOC visit in the mMITT and microbiologically 
evaluable (ME) populations  
 
Per-subject clinical and microbiological response by pathogen at the TOC Visit in the 
mMITT and ME populations 
 
Per-subject relapse rate at the LFU visit in those subjects who were clinically cured at the 
TOC visit 
 
Per-subject reinfection or recurrence rate at the LFU visit in those subjects 
Sample size 
Assuming a point estimate for the primary outcome measure of clinical cure rate of 85% in the 
vancomycin plus aztreonam group and 85% in the ceftaroline group, and a noninferiority margin of 
10%, power of 90%, and a 20% nonevaluable rate, a total sample size of 690 subjects was required 
(345 subjects in each treatment group). 
Randomisation 
Computer-generated block randomization (in groups of four), stratified by country, via an IVRS was 
used to assign subjects (1:1) to the ceftaroline or vancomycin plus aztreonam group.

Blinding (masking) 
This study had a double-blind design. The investigator, study personnel, clinical research organizations 
(including data management personnel), the sponsor (including analysis personnel), and subjects were 
blinded. Maintenance of the study blind at both investigative centers and the Sponsor and CROs was 
implemented according to prospectively written blinding plans. The blinding plans required that the 
Sponsor and CRO study management team and site investigative personnel be divided into blinded and 
unblinded teams. The blinding plans specified procedures that would prevent blinded site personnel 
and blinded study management personnel from access to subject treatment group assignments or 
subject data that could lead to unblinding. 
Statistical methods 
Five study populations were analyzed: 
1. The MITT Population included all randomized subjects who received any amount of study drug; 
2. The cMITT Population was a subset of the MITT Population that included subjects who met the 
minimal clinical disease criteria for a cSSSI; 
3. The mMITT Population was a subset of the cMITT Population that included subjects for whom at 
least one bacterial pathogen was isolated from an appropriate microbiologic specimen (blood or tissue 
obtained from the cSSSI site) at baseline; 
4. The CE Population was a subset of the cMITT Population that included subjects who received at least 
the prespecified minimum amount of the intended dose and duration of study drug therapy, for whom 
sufficient information regarding the cSSSI site was available to determine the subject’s outcome, and 
for whom there were no confounding factors that interfered with the assessment of that outcome; 
5. The ME Population was a subset of the CE Population that included subjects for whom at least one 
bacterial pathogen was isolated from an appropriate microbiologic specimen (blood or tissue obtained 
from the cSSSI site) at baseline. 
A two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the observed difference in the primary outcome measure 
between ceftaroline and vancomycin plus aztreonam was calculated. Noninferiority was concluded if 
the lower limit of the 95% CI was higher than –10%. Assuming a point estimate for the primary 
outcome measure of clinical cure rate of 85% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group and 85% in the 
ceftaroline group, and a noninferiority margin of 10%, power of 90%, and a 20% nonevaluable rate, a 
total sample size of 690 subjects was required (345 subjects in each treatment group). 
Secondary efficacy outcomes were analyzed by determining two-sided 95% CIs for the observed 
difference in the outcome rates between the ceftaroline group and the vancomycin plus aztreonam 
group. Analyses of baseline characteristics and safety outcomes were conducted using, as appropriate, 
a Fisher’s exact test for dichotomous and categorical variables, and a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum (Mann-
Whitney) test for continuous variables. Statistical significance was defined as p < .05 using two-sided 
tests. 
Results 
Of 702 patients enrolled, 616 were CE (316 in the ceftaroline group and 300 in the vancomycin plus 
aztreonam group) and 471 were ME (244 in the ceftaroline group and 227 in the vancomycin plus 
aztreonam group).

 
the primary endpoint of the non-inferiority of ceftaroline compared with vancomycin plus 
aztreonam was demonstrated for the treatment of cSSTI. Clinical cure rates were high and 
similar in both treatment groups at TOC in the MITT population (86.6% for ceftaroline vs 
85.6% for vancomycin plus aztreonam) and in the CE population (91.1% for ceftaroline vs 
93.3% for vancomycin plus aztreonam). 
  Clinical cure rates within clinically relevant subgroups, including patients with PVD, DM, 
polymicrobial infections, and MRSA infections, were favourable and comparable to the overall 
cure rates in the CE population at TOC. 
 
Per-subject microbiological responses at TOC were favourable and similar in both treatment 
groups in the ME and mMITT populations. Clinical cure rates for patients in the MITT, cMITT, 
and CE populations at EOT were similar in both treatment group and slightly greater than those 
at the TOC visit. 
  Clinical cure rates by baseline pathogen were high and similar in both treatment groups in the 
ME population at TOC, including patients with infections due to MSSA and MRSA. 
  Clinical relapse at LFU in those patients who were clinically cured at TOC was rare in both 
treatment groups. No microbiological recurrences were observed in this study.

Participant flow 
In the ITT population 91% completed therapy and about 4% discontinued therapy due to AEs.  
Figure 2: Participant flow for study P903-06 
Recruitment 
A total of 702 patients were randomised: 353 to ceftaroline and 349 to vancomycin plus aztreonam in 
the ITT population; 351 to ceftaroline and 347 to vancomycin plus aztreonam in the MITT and safety 
populations. The demographic and baseline characteristics between treatment groups were similar. 
Patients were predominantly male (63%) and white (75%) with a mean age of 48 years. Treatment 
groups were well balanced with respect to relevant medical and surgical histories (recent trauma, 
25%; DM, 19%; previous skin infection, 14%; and PVD, 14%); infection sizes (lengths, widths, and 
areas); description and locations of the primary infection site (over 50% occurred in lower extremities 
followed by 19% in upper extremities); pathogens that grew from cSSTI specimens (majority due to 
monomicrobial Gram-positive pathogens, with S. aureus the most common pathogen isolated). 
Demographics and baseline characteristics in the cMITT, CE, and ME populations were similar to those 
in the MITT population. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The study design was amended twice.  
Amendment 1 more clearly defined disease and enrolment criteria and safety laboratory 
measurements, changed co-primary analysis population from clinical modified intent-to-treat (cMITT) 
to modified intent-to-treat (MITT), revised secondary outcome measures and sample size calculations, 
and expanded conditions for receipt of OPAT.  
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 51/122
 
 
 
 
 
Amendment 2 implemented recommended changes in the statistical assumptions (power) and 
increased flexibility in dosing of vancomycin according to the institutional guidelines, which included 
weight-based dosing (for heavy subjects) and/or reduced dosing for subjects with impaired renal 
function.  
The changes in study conduct were considered necessary to provide clarity and consistency to the 
multinational study and were not considered to have any meaningful influence on the safety or efficacy 
outcomes of the study. 
Baseline data 
The mean/median age was 48 years (range 18-90 years) and 63% were male subjects. About 18% 
were diabetic and 14% had PVD. Severe erythema was reported in 60%, severe swelling in 40%, 
severe tenderness in 57% and severe discharge in 40%. The mean lesion size was 315 cm2 but the 
median was 180 cm2. The distribution of lesion types was follows: 
Table 6: Description and location of primary site of cSSTI at baseline (MITT population) 
At least one pathogen was obtained from 75% of subjects and 75% of pathogens were S. aureus (32% 
MRSA and 43% MSSA) while 11% were S. pyogenes. Overall 7.4% in the ceftaroline group had a 
pathogen isolated from blood cultures compared to 3.8% in the vancomycin group.  
In each treatment group 40% of subjects had received prior antibacterial therapy for the target 
infection, although mostly for < 24 h and most of those treated for > 48 h had evidence of failure. In 
addition, about 7% per group received another antibacterial agent between randomisation and TOC, 
including 13/25 ceftaroline and 9/26 for reason of failure. The median duration of study treatment was 
7 days in each group and only 1% had treatment extended beyond Day 14. Aztreonam was given for a 
median of 4.5 days in the comparative group. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary analysis demonstrated non-inferiority of ceftaroline vs. comparator in the co-primary 
populations with lower limit of the 95% CI within -7%. The higher number of comparator group 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 52/122
 
 
 
 
 
subjects with indeterminate outcome was due primarily to more subjects being LTFU. Clinical cure 
rates in the cMITT Population were nearly identical to those in the MITT Population. In the CE 
Population the median infection area was zero in both treatment groups at TOC. Similar results were 
found in the MITT Population. 
At TOC the failure rates were 28 (8.9%) for ceftaroline and 20 (6.7%) for comparator (10 and 2 had 
failed between EOT and TOC). The difference was mainly due to more ceftaroline subjects having 
persistent or new cSSSI signs and symptoms than comparator-treated subjects (11 vs. 2). Similar 
results were noted at both time points in the MITT population. Failures not associated with AEs in both 
groups occurred mainly in subjects with co-morbid conditions and no specific host factor was identified 
to be associated with failure. There were 3 subjects per treatment group in the CE population who 
relapsed at late follow-up (21-35 days post-therapy). 
Table 7: Clinical response at the test of cure (TOC) visit (CE and MITT population) 
For subjects with an indeterminate outcome who could be otherwise clinically evaluable the applicant 
conducted post-hoc sensitivity analyses in which these subjects were classified either as clinical cures 
or as clinical failures. In both approaches the lower limit of the 95% CI was above -10%. 
After exclusion of subjects with abscess the cure rates were 219/248 (88.3%) ceftaroline and 214/246 
(87.3%) in the MITT population (95% CI around difference -4.9, 6.9) with rates for the CE population 
at 92% and 92.8% (95% CI -5.8, 4.4).  
The 95% CIs around the treatment differences in the MITT population overlapped and included zero for 
Eastern Europe and Latin America. The treatment difference in the United States among MITT subjects 
was 10.2% (95% CI = 0.2, 20.1) with more clinical cures in the ceftaroline group. In Western Europe 
(2 countries) MITT subjects the pooled treatment difference was -18.7% (95% CI = -36.4, -0.2). This 
was largely due to Poland where 7/29 (28%) ceftaroline but only 2 (8.3%) comparator subjects failed. 
The seven failures in the ceftaroline group were enrolled at two sites but a detailed analysis of these 
cases did not show any obvious trends or reasons accounting for inter-country differences in clinical 
failure rates.

There was no apparent correlation between clinical response at TOC and severity of illness score, either 
overall or by treatment group (table 8). This was a planned analysis but the scoring system was of the 
applicant’s derivation. 
Table 8: Clinical response at TOC visit by treatment group and risk class based on Severity of 
Illness Score (MITT population) 
The per subject microbiological response rates were generally comparable between treatments.  
Table 9: Per-subject microbiological response at the TOC visit (ME and mMITT populations) 
Cure rates for infections associated with Gram-positive species, whether or not polymicrobial, were 
high and comparable between groups. Cure rates were also comparable for those with mixed Gram-
positive and Gram-negative pathogens but lower for ceftaroline among the small numbers with single 
Gram-negative pathogens where the four failures in the ceftaroline group all had Proteus species 
cultured but susceptibility test results were available only for two P. mirabilis, one of which showed 
MIC 16 mg/L. All comparator group subjects with a Gram-negative pathogen received aztreonam.

In the MITT population 21 ceftaroline and 11 comparator group subjects had an organism recovered 
from blood culture and mostly with only one subject per species. There were 9/11 and 6/6 in 
respective groups with S. aureus in blood who were cured (4/5 and 5/5 of these were MSSA). 
The microbiological response rates generally followed the clinical cure rates by pathogen since most 
outcomes were presumed eradication or persistence based on the clinical outcomes.  
Five ceftaroline subjects with only Gram-negative pathogens had an unfavourable microbiological 
response. Three were failures at EOT with presumed persistence of P. mirabilis in one subject [MIC > 
16 μg/mL] and P. vulgaris group in two subjects [no MIC result] and these subjects had required 
debridement and/or amputation. Two were clinical cures at EOT, TOC and LFU but had microbiological 
evidence of persistence of Serratia marcescens (MIC 0.5 μg/mL) and P. aeruginosa (MIC 8 μg/mL) plus 
A. calcoaceticus. The 15 subjects with only Gram-negative pathogens in the comparator group all 
received aztreonam to which most isolates were susceptible. There was one instance of an increase in 
MIC ceftaroline during treatment. One subject had E. cloacae at baseline with MIC 1-2 μg/mL but the 
EOT isolate (identical to the baseline isolate by PFGE and ribotyping) was confirmed to have MIC = 16-
>16 μg/mL and expressed chromosomal AmpC β-lactamase at higher levels vs. the baseline isolate.

Microbiological responses at TOC were analysed according to two or more signs and symptoms of 
severe cSSSI at baseline (89.6% ceftaroline vs. 84.4% comparator in the MITT population), fever 
(90% both groups), leukocytosis > 10,000 WBC/mm3 (78.5% vs. 80.8%), age > 75 years (10/14 vs. 
16/20) or < 75 years (87.2% vs. 84%), diabetes (44/53 vs. 47/51), PVD (33/39 vs. 31/41), mono- 
and polymicrobial infection (also ± MRSA), moderate renal insufficiency (6/8 and 10/13) and abscess 
> 5 cm (58/68 vs. 57/74). The 95% CIs around the treatment differences were sometimes wide due to 
small numbers per subgroup but included zero except for monomicrobial MRSA (lower 95% CI above 
zero, i.e. in favour of ceftaroline). 
Study P903-07 in cSSTI: A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparative 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ceftaroline versus vancomycin plus aztreonam in 
adult subjects with complicated skin and skin structure infection 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The study was conducted between March and December 2007 (dates of first enrolment and last 
completion) in 56 study centers from 12 countries (Europe, Latin America and the United States). 
The mean/median age was 47 - 48 years (range 18-96 years) and 63% overall were male subjects 
(65.5% ceftaroline and 59.5% comparator). About 18% and 15% in respective groups were diabetic 
while 14% and 12% had PVD. Baseline features of cSSTI were considered severe for erythema in 55% 
and 53% per group, swelling in 46%, tenderness in 51% and 53% and discharge was purulent in 
about 54% overall. The mean lesion areas were 284 and 279 cm2 in respective groups but the median 
areas were 151 and 120 cm2. The distribution of lesion types contrasted with P903-06 in that 
abscesses predominated over cellulitis.

Treatments 
Ceftaroline fosamil 600 mg was administered intravenously over 60 minutes every 12 hours, followed 
by placebo administered over 60 minutes every 12 hours. Vancomycin 1 g was administered over 60 
minutes every 12 hours followed by aztreonam 1 g administered over 60 minutes every 12 hours. The 
duration of therapy was from 5-14 days with up to 21 days allowed (sponsor approval for individual 
subjects. 
Objectives 
See study P903-06. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The coprimary efficacy outcome measures were the per-subject clinical cure rate at the TOC Visit in the 
CE and MITT populations. Subjects were considered clinically cured at the TOC visit if they had total 
resolution of all signs and symptoms of the baseline infection, or improvement of the infection such 
that no further antimicrobial therapy was necessary. 
The secondary efficacy outcome measures were: 
 
 
 
Per-subject clinical cure rate at the TOC visit in the clinical MITT (cMITT) population. 
Per-subject clinical cure rate at the EOT visit in the MITT, cMITT, and CE populations 
Per-subject microbiological response at the TOC visit in the microbiological MITT (mMITT) and 
microbiologically evaluable (ME) populations. 
 
Per-subject clinical and microbiological response by pathogen at the TOC visit in the mMITT 
and ME populations 
 
Per-subject relapse rate at the LFU visit in those subjects who were clinically cured at the TOC 
visit 
 
Per-subject reinfection or recurrence rate at the LFU visit in those subjects who had a favorable 
microbiological outcome (eradication or presumed eradication) at the TOC visit 
Sample size 
Assuming a point estimate for the clinical cure rate of 85% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group 
and 85% in the ceftaroline group in the CE population, a non-inferiority margin of 10%, a power of 
90%, and a 20% non-evaluable rate, a total sample size of 690 patients was required (345 patients in 
each treatment group). 
Randomisation 
Block randomization using an interactive voice response system (IVRS), stratified by country was used 
to assign subjects (1:1) to the ceftaroline or vancomycin plus aztreonam groups.

Results 
Of 694 patients enrolled, 586 were CE (294 in the ceftaroline group and 292 in the vancomycin plus 
aztreonam group) and 443 were ME (224 in the ceftaroline group and 219 in the vancomycin plus 
aztreonam group). 
 
The primary objective of determining the non-inferiority of ceftaroline compared with 
vancomycin plus aztreonam was demonstrated for the treatment of cSSTI.  
  Clinical cure rates were high and similar between the treatment groups at TOC in the MITT 
population (85.1% for ceftaroline vs 85.5% for vancomycin plus aztreonam) and CE population 
(92.2% for ceftaroline vs 92.1% for vancomycin plus aztreonam). 
  Clinical cure rates within clinically-relevant subgroups, including patients with PVD, DM, 
polymicrobial infections, and MRSA infections, were comparable to the overall cures rates in 
the CE population at TOC. 
 
Per-subject microbiological responses at TOC were similar between the 2 treatment groups in 
both the ME and mMITT populations. 
  Clinical cure rates for patients in the MITT, cMITT, and CE populations at EOT were similar in 
the 2 treatment groups and slightly greater than those at the TOC visit. 
  Clinical cure rates by baseline pathogen were high and similar between the 2 treatment groups 
in the ME population at the TOC visit, including patients with infections due to MSSA and 
MRSA. 
  Clinical relapse at LFU in those patients who were clinically cured at TOC was rare in both 
treatment groups. No microbiological recurrences were observed in this study. 
Participant flow 
In the ITT population 91% ceftaroline and 88% comparator group subjects completed therapy while 
2% and 5% in respective groups discontinued due to AEs.

Recruitment 
A total of 694 patients were randomised: 348 to ceftaroline and 346 to vancomycin plus aztreonam in 
the ITT population; 342 to ceftaroline and 338 to vancomycin plus aztreonam in the MITT and safety 
populations. Patients were predominately male (63%) and white (74%) with a mean age of 48 years. 
Treatment groups were well balanced with respect to relevant medical and surgical histories (recent 
trauma, 30%; DM, 17%; previous skin infection, 10%; and PVD, 13%); infection size (length, width, 
and area); description and location of the primary infection site (43% occurred in the lower extremity 
and 31% in an upper extremity); and the pathogens that grew from cSSTI specimens (majority due to 
monomicrobial Gram-positive pathogens, with S. aureus the most common pathogen isolated). 
Demographics and baseline characteristics in the cMITT, CE, and ME populations were similar to those 
in the MITT population.

Baseline data 
The mean/median age was 47 - 48 years (range 18-96 years) and 63% overall were male subjects 
(65.5% ceftaroline and 59.5% comparator). About 18% and 15% in respective groups were diabetic 
while 14% and 12% had PVD. Baseline features of cSSTI were considered severe for erythema in 55%

about 54% overall. The mean lesion areas were 284 and 279 cm2 in respective groups but the median 
areas were 151 and 120 cm2. The distribution of lesion types contrasted with P903-06 in that 
abscesses predominated over cellulitis.

Table 11: Description and location of primary site of cSSTI at baseline (MITT population) 
At least one pathogen was obtained from 76% of subjects and about 82% of all pathogens were S. 
aureus (30% MRSA and 52% MSSA) while 12.5% were S. pyogenes. Overall 5% had a pathogen 
isolated from blood cultures including 9 (3.3%) in the ceftaroline group and 14 (5.4%) in the 
comparative group.  
There were 34.8% ceftaroline and 32.5% comparator group subjects who had received prior 
antibacterial therapy for the target infection, although mostly for < 24 h and most of those treated for 
> 48 h had evidence of failure. In addition, 30 subjects (~ 9%) per group received another 
antibacterial agent between randomisation and TOC, including 17/30 ceftaroline and 15/30 comparator 
subjects treated for reason of failure. The median duration of study treatment was 6.5 days in each 
group with means of 7.4 days and 2.5% extended therapy beyond day 14. Aztreonam was given for a 
median of 3.5 days. 
Outcomes and estimation 
In the CE and MITT populations non-inferiority of ceftaroline vs. comparative therapy was 
demonstrated with lower 95% CI within -6. Clinical cure rates in the cMITT population were nearly 
identical to those in the MITT population. Most of the indeterminate outcomes were due to loss to 
follow-up or the subject’s withdrawal of consent. By TOC, the median infection area was zero in both 
treatment groups. Similar results applied to the MITT population. 
Three ceftaroline and two comparator group subjects experienced a clinical relapse at LFU after having 
been designated as cured at TOC. 
For subjects with an indeterminate outcome who could be otherwise clinically evaluable the applicant 
conducted post-hoc sensitivity analyses in which these subjects were classified either as clinical cures 
or as clinical failures. In both approaches the lower limit of the 95% CI was above -10%. 
Zinforo 
Assessment report

After exclusion of subjects with abscess the cure rates were 164/179 (91.6%) ceftaroline and 165/181 
(91.2%) in the CE population (95% CI around difference -5.6, 6.5) with rates for the MITT population 
at 86.6% and 86.3% (95% CI -6.4, 7.1).  
Table 12: Clinical response at the TOC visit (CE and MITT populations) 
There was no apparent correlation between clinical response at TOC and severity of illness score.  
Table 13: Overall clinical response at TOC visit by risk class based on Severity of Ilness 
Score (MITT population) 
Overall per-subject microbiological response at TOC for the ME and mMITT populations gave 
comparable rates with lower 95% CI above -8.  
There were two ceftaroline subjects with only Gram-negative pathogens who had an unfavourable 
microbiological response. One was a failure at EOT with presumed persistence of P. aeruginosa and M. 
morganii. The other was a clinical cure at EOT, TOC and LFU but had microbiological evidence of 
persistence of E. cloacae (MIC 0.12 – 0.25 μg/mL). The 9 subjects with only Gram-negative pathogens 
in the comparator group all received aztreonam to which most isolates were susceptible. There was no 
instance of an increase in MIC ceftaroline during treatment in this study.

Table 14: Per-subject microbiological response at the TOC visit (ME and mMITT populations) 
The clinical cure rates at TOC by baseline pathogen gave generally comparable rates, including rates 
for those with monomicrobial and polymicrobial infections. The clinical response rates for S. aureus 
infections (MRSA and MSSA) and streptococcal infections were high and comparable between 
treatments. The per pathogen microbiological response rates closely resembled clinical response rates. 
Microbiological responses at TOC were analysed according to two or more signs and symptoms of 
severe cSSSI at baseline (90.3% ceftaroline vs. 92.4% comparator in the MITT population), fever 
(87% vs. 92%), leukocytosis > 10,000 WBC/mm3 (86.3% vs. 90.6%), age > 75 years (13/16 vs. 
12/16) or < 75 years (87% vs. 89%), diabetes (37/46 vs. 33/36), PVD (37/44 vs. 33/35), mono- and 
polymicrobial infection (also ± MRSA), moderate renal insufficiency (7/7 and 10/12) and abscess > 5 
cm (85% vs. 88%). The 95% CIs around the treatment differences were sometimes wide due to small 
numbers per subgroup but included zero.

Ancillary analyses 
Clinical response at TOC was examined for a variety of subgroups: infection type, disease severity, co-
morbid conditions, demographic and baseline characteristics and by protocol amendment. Subgroup 
analyses based on demographic and baseline disease characteristics were performed in the CE 
population only. For the region group and protocol amendments subgroups, the analyses were 
performed in the MITT and CE populations. Generally, point estimates of the treatment differences for 
all subgroups of sufficient size were of comparable magnitude to the overall population, demonstrating 
the robustness of the conclusions. Not surprisingly, observed treatment differences (ceftaroline – 
vancomycin plus aztreonam) in clinical cure rates among smaller subgroups were more variable.

Study P903-08 in CAP: A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparative study 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone, with adjunctive 
clarithromycin, in the treatment of adult subjects with community-acquired pneumonia

duration of therapy was 5-7 days. Both treatment groups also received two doses of oral 
clarithromycin (500 mg) q12h (± 2 hours) as adjunctive therapy on Study Day 1 only. 
Objectives 
Primary: 
To determine the noninferiority in the clinical cure rate for ceftaroline compared to that for ceftriaxone 
at the test of cure (TOC) visit in the clinically evaluable (CE) and modified intent to treat efficacy 
(MITTE) populations in adult subjects with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). 
Secondary: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To evaluate the clinical response at End-of-Therapy (EOT) 
To evaluate the microbiological success rate at TOC 
To evaluate the overall (clinical and radiographic) success rate at TOC 
To evaluate the clinical and microbiological response by pathogen at TOC 
To evaluate clinical relapse at late follow-up (LFU) 
To evaluate microbiological reinfection/recurrence at LFU 
To evaluate safety 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The clinical cure at the TOC Visit was the primary outcome measure and was to be determined for the 
co-primary study populations - the CE and MITTE Populations. The analysis of non-inferiority was 
based on a pre-specified margin of 10%. 
Subjects were considered clinically cured at TOC if they had total resolution of all signs and symptoms 
of the baseline infection or improvement of the infection to such an extent that no further antimicrobial 
therapy was considered to be necessary. The TOC visit window was 8-15 days after EOT for the CE 
population but in the final SAP the general windows applied were 7-20 days post-treatment for TOC 
and 21-45 days for LFU. 
Sample size 
Assuming a point estimate for the clinical cure rate in the CE Population of 90% in the ceftriaxone 
treatment group, and 90% in the ceftaroline group, a noninferiority margin of 10%, a power of 90%, 
and a 25% nonevaluability rate, and that 60 subjects in PORT Risk Class II were enrolled, a total 
sample size of 610 subjects was required to demonstrate noninferiority of ceftaroline to ceftriaxone 
based on the CE population. For the same sample size this study was expected to have at least 90% 
power to show noninferiority based on the MITTE Population (305 subjects in each treatment group). 
Randomisation 
The study was randomised by using block randomisation using IVRS, stratified by country and severity 
of disease to assign subjects (1:1) to ceftaroline or ceftriaxone. 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 65/122
 
 
 
 
Blinding (masking) 
The study had a double-blind design. The investigator (including data management and analysis 
personnel), CROs, study personnel and subjects were all blinded to the study therapy. Maintenance of 
the study blind at both investigative centers and the sponsor and CROs was implemented according to 
prospectively written blinding plans.  
Statistical methods 
There were seven study populations, six of which were statistically analyzed. 
 
 
The ITT Population included all randomized subjects and was not analyzed 
The MITT Population included all randomized subjects who received any amount of the study 
drug 
 
The MITTE Population consisted of all subjects in the MITT Population in PORT Risk Class III or 
IV 
 
The mMITT Population consisted of all subjects in the MITT Population who met the minimal 
disease criteria for CABP, and who had at least one typical bacterial organism consistent with a 
CABP pathogen identified from an appropriate microbiological specimen (eg, blood, sputum, or 
pleural fluid). Subjects with M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae as the sole causative pathogen 
of infection, and all subjects with L. pneumophila infection were excluded from the mMITT 
population. 
 
The mMITTE Population consisted of all subjects in the mMITT Population in PORT Risk Class III 
or IV 
 
The CE Population consisted of all subjects in the MITTE Population who met minimal disease 
criteria for CABP and all evaluability criteria, including subjects who received at least the 
prespecified minimal amount of the intended dose and duration of study drug therapy, for 
whom sufficient information regarding the infection was available to determine the subject’s 
outcome; subjects with Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydophila pneumoniae as the sole 
causative pathogen of infection, and all subjects with L. pneumophila infection, were excluded 
from the CE Population. 
 
The ME Population was a subset of the CE and mMITTE Populations and included each subject 
in the CE Population who also had at least one “typical” bacterial pathogen that had been 
isolated from an appropriate microbiological specimen 
A two-sided 95% CI for the observed difference in the primary outcome measure (clinical cure rate) 
between the ceftaroline group and the ceftriaxone group was calculated based on each of the CE and 
the MITTE Populations at the TOC visit. Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower limit of the 95% CI 
was higher than –10% for each of the CE and MITTE Populations. 
Results 
Of 614 patients enrolled, 591 were clinically evaluable (291 in the ceftaroline group and 300 in the 
ceftriaxone group) and 157 were microbiologically evaluable (75 in the ceftaroline group and 82 in the 
ceftriaxone group). The primary objective of determining the noninferiority of ceftaroline compared 
with ceftriaxone was demonstrated for the treatment of CABP. Clinical cure rates were higher in the 
ceftaroline group than the ceftriaxone group at TOC in the MITTE (83.8% and 77.7%, respectively) and 
CE Populations (86.6% and 78.2%, respectively). The noninferiority of ceftaroline compared with 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 66/122
 
 
 
 
ceftriaxone was demonstrated in both of the coprimary populations, as the lower limits of the 95% CIs 
around the treatment differences (ceftaroline - ceftriaxone) were greater than the prespecified 
noninferiority boundary of -10% (-0.2% for the MITTE Population and 1.4% for the CE Population).  
Clinical cure rates at TOC in the ME, mMITTE, and mMITT Populations were higher in the ceftaroline 
group than the ceftriaxone group. Clinical cure rates at EOT were higher in the ceftaroline group than 
the ceftriaxone group for both the MITTE and CE Populations, and the noninferiority of ceftaroline 
compared with ceftriaxone was demonstrated in both populations, as the lower limits of the 95% CIs 
around the treatment differences ceftaroline - ceftriaxone) were greater than the prespecified 
noninferiority boundary of -10%;  
Participant flow 
Figure 4: Participant flow in study P903-08 
Recruitment 
A total of 614 patients were randomised: 305 to ceftaroline and 309 to ceftriaxone (intent-to-treat 
[ITT] population); 299 to ceftaroline and 307 to ceftriaxone in the MITT or safety population. Patients 
in both treatment groups also received 2 doses of oral adjunctive therapy (clarithromycin) starting on 
Day 1 following randomisation. The demographic and baseline characteristics between treatment 
groups were similar. Patients were predominately male (64%), non-Hispanic (91%), and white (89%), 
and had a mean age of 61 years. 
Treatment groups were well balanced with respect to relevant medical and surgical histories (structural 
lung disease [21%], gastro-oesophageal reflux [3%], asthma [9%], chronic sinusitis [1%], alcohol 
abuse [3%], and prior pneumonia [19%]). In the MITTE population, approximately 63% of patients 
had PORT risk class III and 37% were in Class IV; there was a higher percentage of ceftriaxone 
patients in Class IV (39% vs. 35% for ceftaroline). There were similar CAP pathogen recovery rates of 
approximately 26% in the 2 treatment groups, with comparable pathogens, the majority of which were 
monomicrobial Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. The most commonly isolated pathogen

was S. pneumoniae. Demographics and baseline characteristics in the MITT and CE populations were 
similar to those in the MITTE population.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol was dated January 12, 2007. No subjects were enrolled under the original 
protocol. During the study, there were four protocol amendments:  
Amendment 1 (July 25, 2007) 
 
Increased the sample size of evaluable subjects from 510 to 550 and the number in each 
treatment group from 255 to 275. 
 
The adjunctive macrolide therapy was changed from azithromycin to shorter-acting 
clarithromycin, and the potential for oral switch to amoxicillin-clavulanate was eliminated. 
Amendment 2 (November 13, 2007) 
  Excluded subjects with PORT Risk Class II from the study; restricted primary efficacy analyses 
to subjects with PORT Risk Class III and IV 
 
Increased the sample size to 610 subjects (305 per treatment arm) as it was assumed that 60 
subjects in PORT Risk Class II had been enrolled before implementation of this amendment. 
Thus, 60 additional subjects were need to ensure 90% power in the CE Population to 
determine noninferiority. 
Amendment 3 (October 20, 2008) 
  Administrative amendment only 
Amendment 4 (June 9, 2009) 
  Changed the primary efficacy parameter from “overall (clinical and radiographic) response at 
TOC visit” to “clinical response at TOC visit” 
  Removed the test of superiority from primary efficacy analyses 
 
Included all-cause death as clinical failure in analyses 
Baseline data 
The mean age was 61 years (median 64 years) and 64% of subjects were male while half (49%) were 
over 65 years and nearly a quarter (23%) were over 75 years. At baseline 35% were hypoxic, 65% 
were febrile and 22% had both hypoxia and fever. About 70% had a single lobe and 30% multilobar 
CAP while 20% had an effusion. In the MITTE population two thirds had PORT score III (65% 
ceftaroline and 61% comparator) and 37% had a score of IV (35% and 39%). Also, 77% per group 
had CURB-65 scores of 1-2, which approximate to PORT scores of III-IV in terms of predicted mortality 
rates, while 10% had a score of at least 3. 
In the mMITTE population 51% had at least one Gram-positive pathogen (37% had S. pneumoniae) 
while 57% had at least one Gram-negative pathogen (as designated by the applicant) although these 
were mostly enterobacterial species. Nearly 80% had only one pathogen. Overall 17 subjects had a 
pathogen found in blood culture of which 12 were S. pneumoniae (7 and 5 per group). About 10% also 
had evidence of an atypical pathogen (noting that those with evidence of Legionella were excluded 
from the MITT, mMITTE and ME populations). 
Approximately 48% of MITT subjects had received prior antibacterial therapy for CAP in the 96 h prior 
to randomisation. However, almost all of these subjects had received a single dose of a short acting

agent by the oral or parenteral route, none had received 48 h or more prior therapy and only 2 
ceftaroline and 4 comparator subjects were excluded from the CE population due to prior therapy. The 
median duration of study treatment was 6.5 days, 83% and 87% per group received from 5-8 days 
and no subject received > 8 days.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Non-inferiority of ceftaroline vs. ceftriaxone was demonstrated in the co-primary populations with 
lower limits of the 95% CIs within -1. The comparison in the CE population gave 95% CI around the 
treatment difference that did not span zero and favoured ceftaroline. Cure rates for all treated subjects 
(MITT) were 82.9% and 77.6% (95% CI -1.0, 11.8).  
Table 16: Clinical response at TOC (CE and MITTE populations) 
For the 15 subjects with an indeterminate outcome who could be otherwise clinically evaluable 
additional sensitivity analyses (CE population) in which these subjects were classified either as cures or 
failures gave higher cure rates for ceftaroline and lower limits of the 95% CI around the differences 
that were within -10% (1.7%, 16.3% and -0.9%, 13.6%). 
Among the failures in the MITTE population 31/34 in the ceftaroline group and 53/58 in the ceftriaxone 
group were due to persistence, incomplete resolution or worsening of CABP. There were 6 deaths in 
each treatment group, with 4 and 5 per group within 30 days in the MITTE population, of which 1 and 
3 were thought to be due to CAP. 
In an analysis in which only subjects with complete resolution of signs and symptoms were counted as 
cures there were much lower cure rates but there was still a numerical advantage for ceftaroline and 
the lower 95% CI were within -3. 
In CE and MITTE populations the cure rates at TOC were higher for ceftaroline in those who did not 
receive other antibacterial agents within 96 hours of the first dose of study drug (MITTE 90.3% vs. 
77.1% for ceftriaxone; CE 91.6% vs. 75%) compared to those who did (MITTE 76.6% vs. 78.3%; CE 
81% vs. 82.1%). 
Clinical outcomes in the CE population by region showed that in areas where 10 or more subjects were 
enrolled the pattern of responses was in line with the overall treatment differences in the study with 
the exception of Germany (9/13 ceftaroline and 12/13 ceftriaxone).

In the CE Population the clinical cure rates in the ceftaroline group were similar to or higher than those 
in the ceftriaxone group for most subsets examined, including PORT Risk Class III. Rates were 
comparable between treatments in those aged over 75 years, with a CURB-65 score of 3, in PORT Risk 
Class IV or with moderate renal impairment. 
The analysis of clinical outcomes applied to other pre-defined populations (mMITTE, ME, mMITT) also 
gave 95% CI around the treatment differences that did not span zero and favoured ceftaroline. 
By-pathogen clinical outcomes for the two most common pathogens were as shown below. The same 
pattern applied regardless of the pneumococcal susceptibility to penicillin and for cases diagnosed only 
by urinary antigen. Results for the mMITTE population were similar. 
Table 17: Clinical response at test of cure by baseline pathogen (ME population) 
Clinical cure was observed for 6/8 ceftaroline and 4/7 ceftriaxone ME subjects at TOC with a pathogen 
isolated from baseline blood culture. Rates were 6/7 and 3/5 for those with pneumococcal 
bacteraemia.  
Since most microbiological responses per subject and by-pathogen were presumed it follows that the 
rates resembled those for clinical outcomes at TOC. For example, in the mMITT population all those 
with clinical cure at TOC had a favourable microbiological outcome.  
There were no documented cases of re-infection or recurrence at LFU and no evidence of decreasing 
susceptibility to ceftaroline while on therapy. 
Ancillary analyses 
Additional analyses across a variety of subgroups including demographic and baseline characteristics, 
geographical regions, disease severity, comorbid conditions, and the subset of patients who had not 
received prior systemic antibacterials were conducted and showed consistent treatment effects.

I. Radiographically-confirmed pneumonia with new or progressive pulmonary infiltrate(s) on chest 
radiograph (CXR) or chest computed tomography (CT) scan consistent with bacterial pneumonia 
AND 
II. Acute illness of ≤ 7 days duration with ≥ 3 of the following: new or increased cough, purulent

Important exclusions included: 
o  Confirmed or suspected non-bacterial and/or non-community-acquired CAP or atypical CAP (based 
on L. pneumophila urinary antigen plus serology for atypical pathogens)  
o  Pathogen known or very likely to be resistant to ceftriaxone (e.g. P. aeruginosa, MRSA) 
o  Previous antibacterial treatment of CAP within 96 h pre-randomisation unless this consisted only of 
a single dose of a short-acting agent or there was unequivocal clinical evidence of treatment failure

o  CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min or < 500 neutrophils/mm3 or platelet count < 60,000 cells/mm3 
o  HIV positive with CD4 < 200 cells/mm3  
Treatments 
Ceftaroline fosamil was administered as 2 x 30 min infusions of 300 mg given consecutively every 
12 h to maintain the blind vs. ceftriaxone 1 g administered once daily as 30-min infusions. The dose 
was adjusted to 400 mg in case of moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl >30 and up to 50 ml/min). The 
duration of therapy was 5-7 days. 
Objectives 
Primary: 
To determine the noninferiority in the clinical cure rate for ceftaroline compared with that for 
ceftriaxone at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit in the clinically evaluable (CE) and modified intent-to-treat 
efficacy (MITTE) populations in adult subjects with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). 
Secondary: 
1. To evaluate the clinical response at End-of-Therapy (EOT) 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 72/122
 
 
 
 
2. To evaluate the microbiological success rate at TOC 
3. To evaluate the overall (clinical and radiographic) success rate at TOC 
4. To evaluate the clinical and microbiological response by pathogen at TOC 
5. To evaluate clinical relapse at Late Follow-up (LFU) 
6. To evaluate microbiological reinfection/recurrence at LFU 
7. To evaluate safety 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was the per-subject clinical cure rate at TOC in the CE and 
MITTE populations. The analysis of non-inferiority was based on a pre-specified margin of 10%. 
Subjects were considered clinically cured at TOC if they had total resolution of all signs and symptoms 
of the baseline infection, or improvement of the infection such that no further antimicrobial therapy 
was necessary. In addition, the clinical response at TOC was evaluated in the mMITT, mMITTE, and ME 
Populations. 
Sample size 
Assuming a point estimate for the clinical cure rate in the CE Population of 90% in the ceftriaxone 
group, and 90% in the ceftaroline group, a noninferiority margin of 10%, a power of 90% and 25% 
nonevaluability rate, and 76 subjects in PORT Risk Class II were enrolled, a total sample size of 626 
subjects was required to demonstrate noninferiority of ceftaroline to ceftriaxone based on the CE 
population. For the same sample size this study was expected to have at least 90% power to show 
noninferiority based on the MITTE Population (313 subjects in each treatment group). 
Randomisation 
Block randomization using an interactive voice response system (IVRS), stratified bycountry and 
severity of disease, was used to assign subjects (1:1) to the ceftaroline or ceftriaxone group. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study had a double-blind design. The investigator (including data management and analysis 
personnel), CROs, study personnel and subjects were all blinded to the study therapy. Maintenance of 
the study blind at both investigative centers and the sponsor and CROs was implemented according to 
prospectively written blinding plans.  
Statistical methods

Results 
Of 627 patients enrolled, 562 were clinically evaluable (289 in the ceftaroline group and 273 in the 
ceftriaxone group) and 201 were microbiologically evaluable (99 in the ceftaroline group and 102 in 
the ceftriaxone group). The primary objective of the non-inferiority of ceftaroline compared with 
ceftriaxone was confirmed for the treatment of CAP. Clinical cure rates were higher in the ceftaroline 
group than the ceftriaxone group at TOC in both the MITTE and CE populations. Clinical cure rates at

TOC in the ME, mMITTE, and mMITT populations were similar to those observed for the CE and MITTE 
populations. Clinical cure rates at EOT were higher in the ceftaroline group than the ceftriaxone group 
for both the MITTE and CE populations, and the non-inferiority of ceftaroline compared with ceftriaxone 
was demonstrated in both populations. Per-patient microbiological favourable outcome rates at TOC 
were similar in the 2 treatment groups in the mMITT population and non-inferiority of ceftaroline was 
demonstrated compared with ceftriaxone. The by-patient favourable microbiological outcome rates at 
TOC in both the ME and mMITTE populations supported these conclusions. The overall (clinical and 
radiographic) success rates for both treatment groups in both the CE and MITTE populations were 
essentially identical to those observed for clinical cure rate alone in the primary analysis; radiographic 
success rates and treatment differences were concordant with clinical cure rates and treatment 
differences for the CE and MITTE populations. Clinical cure rates and favourable microbiological 
outcome rates by pathogen at TOC in the mMITT, mMITTE and ME populations were higher in the 
ceftaroline group than in the ceftriaxone group for patients with infections due to Gram-positive 
pathogens including S. pneumoniae. The clinical cure rates and favourable microbiological rates in 
patients with infections due to respiratory Gram-negative bacilli (including H. influenzae, H. 
parainfluenzae, and K. pneumoniae) were similar in the 2 treatment groups.

Recruitment 
Conduct of the study 
Baseline data 
The mean age was 61 years (median 63 years) and 62% of subjects were male while 47% were over 
65 years and 21% were over 75 years. At baseline 37% were hypoxic, 48% were febrile and 17% had 
both hypoxia and fever. About 74% had a single lobe involved and 26% had multilobar CAP while 17% 
had an effusion. In the MITTE population 61% had PORT score III (59% ceftaroline and 63% 
comparator) and 39% had a score of IV (41% and 37%). Also, 76% per group had CURB-65 scores of 
1-2, which approximate to PORT scores of III-IV in terms of predicted mortality rates, while 10% had a 
score of at least 3. 
In the mMITTE population 62% had at least one Gram-positive pathogen (46% had S. pneumoniae) 
and 39% had at least one Gram-negative pathogen (26% had Haemophilus spp.). Almost all mMITTE 
subjects had a single pathogen. Overall 26 mMITTE subjects had a pathogen found in blood culture (15 
ceftaroline and 11 comparator) of which 19 were S. pneumoniae (12 and 7 per group). About 14% also 
had evidence of an atypical pathogen (noting that those with evidence of Legionella were excluded 
from the MITT, mMITTE and ME populations). 
Approximately 36% ceftaroline and 42% ceftriaxone MITT subjects had received prior antibacterial 
therapy for CAP in the 96 h prior to randomisation. All of these subjects (3 exceptions) had received a 
single dose of a short acting agent by the oral or parenteral route, none had received ≥48 h therapy 
and only 3 were excluded from the CE population due to prior therapy. The median duration of study 
treatment was 6.0 days with means of 5.9 days, 89% and 86% per group received from 5-8 days and 
no subject received > 8 days.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Non-inferiority of ceftaroline vs. ceftriaxone was demonstrated in the co-primary populations with 
lower limits of the 95% CIs within -3. Cure rates in the MITT (all treated) population were 81.9% and 
76.5% (95% CI -1.0, 11.8). 
Table 18: Clinical response at TOC (CE and MITTE populations)

Assessment report

For the 13 subjects with an indeterminate outcome who could be otherwise clinically evaluable 
additional sensitivity analyses (CE population) in which these subjects were classified either as cures or 
failures gave higher cure rates for ceftaroline (82% vs. 78% and 81% vs. 74% in respective 
classification approaches) and lower limits of the 95% CI around the differences that were within -10% 
(-3.1, 11.6 and -0.3, 16, respectively). 
Among the failures in the MITTE population 37/47 in the ceftaroline group and 51/56 in the ceftriaxone 
group were due to persistence, incomplete resolution or worsening of CABP. There were 8 deaths in 
the ceftaroline group and 5 in the ceftriaxone group within 30 days of end of treatment or LFU in the 
MITTE population, of which one in the ceftaroline group was thought to be due to CAP by the 
investigator. 
In an analysis in which only subjects with complete resolution of signs and symptoms were counted as 
cures there were much lower cure rates but there was still a numerical advantage (MITTE) for 
ceftaroline or comparability between treatments (CE) and the lower 95% CI were within -9. 
Table 19: Clinical response at TOC (clinical cure defined as total resolution of all symptoms 
and signs of CAP)-CE and MITTE populations 
In CE and MITTE populations the cure rates at TOC for ceftaroline were slightly higher for those who 
received other antibacterial agents within 96 hours of the first dose of study drug compared to those 
who did not (MITTE 84% with and 80% without; CE 84% and 81%, respectively). In the ceftriaxone 
group the pattern was the same but the difference was greater (MITTE 80% with and 72% without; CE 
81% and 75%). 
In the CE Population the clinical cure rates in the ceftaroline group were similar to or slightly higher 
than those in the ceftriaxone group for most subsets examined, including PORT Risk Class III or IV, 
age over 75 years and CURB-65 scores 1-3. 
The analyses of clinical outcomes applied to other three pre-defined populations gave lower bounds of 
the 95% CI around the treatment differences that all fell within -9%.  
By-pathogen clinical outcomes for the two most common pathogens were as shown below. The same 
pattern applied regardless of the pneumococcal susceptibility to penicillin and for cases diagnosed only 
by urinary antigen. Results for the mMITTE population were similar. 
Clinical cure was observed for 9/13 ceftaroline (10 microbiological success) and 6/10 ceftriaxone (7 
microbiological success) ME subjects at TOC with a pathogen isolated from baseline blood culture. 
Microbiological response rates were 8/10 and 4/6 for those with pneumococcal bacteraemia. Two 
ceftaroline subjects had S. aureus bacteraemia (MSSA) along with positive respiratory specimens and 
failed therapy. In addition, it seems that for all subjects with S. pneumoniae bacteraemia and an 
outcome recorded in this study the clinical cure rates were 14/17 ceftaroline and 7/11 ceftriaxone.

Assessment report

Table 20: Clinical response at the TOC visit by baseline pathogen (ME population) 
Since most microbiological responses per subject and by-pathogen were presumed it follows that the 
rates closely resembled those for clinical outcomes at TOC. For example, in the mMITT population 99% 
with clinical cure at TOC had a favourable microbiological outcome. Two subjects per treatment group 
had an unfavourable microbiological outcome despite being classified as clinical cures. There were also 
3 ceftaroline and 6 ceftriaxone subjects who failed clinically but had a favourable microbiological 
response. 
Table 21: Per-subject microbiological response at the TOC visit overall (mMITT, mMITTE and 
ME populations) 
Rates for favourable microbiological outcomes were the same for S. aureus (11/15 and 73% per 
treatment group). However, the rates of favourable microbiological outcomes for S. pneumoniae were 
34/39 (87%) for ceftaroline and 25/32 (78%) for ceftriaxone, which closely resembled the clinical cure 
rates.

Assessment report

In both treatment groups and both co-primary populations, the relapse rate at LFU following 
designation of cure at TOC was less than 3%. In the MITTE population there were 5 relapses following 
ceftaroline and 2 following ceftriaxone. There were no documented cases of re-infection or recurrence 
at LFU and no evidence of decreasing susceptibility to ceftaroline while on therapy.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Analysis performed across the two Phase 3 cSSTI studies 
There were some differences noted for rates of surgical interventions although the pooled data gave 
comparable findings between treatments. The majority of patients who underwent relevant incision 
and drainage were enrolled with abscesses (64.2%). The clinical cure rates amongst patients 
randomised to ceftaroline and vancomycin plus aztreonam in P903-06 and P903-07 combined were 
comparable within the subset that had relevant incision and drainage (92.3% [203/220] and 94.0% 
[202/215]), respectively; CE population) and the subset with no relevant incision and drainage (91.3% 
[356/390] and 92.0% [347/377], respectively; CE population).  
For most demographic, medical history and current disease variables the treatment groups were 
generally comparable across the two studies. In particular, approximatively 30% had a fever and about 
one third had an elevated WBC at baseline while just < 25% had SIRS. A review of the literature 
showed that in fact these rates were not so very different from those reported from some other studies 
in cSSTI within the last decade. 
Further exploration of the incidence of fever, elevated WBC and SIRS according to those who did and 
did not receive prior antibacterial therapy within 2 days of randomisation showed that among the 528 
total patients who received prior antibacterial agents 22.3% met the fever criteria vs. 34.7% of those 
without. In contrast 25.4% who had received prior agents met the SIRS criteria at baseline vs. 21.6% 
without and raised WBC (cut-off 10,000 cells/mm3) was present in 40.7% vs. 33.5%, respectively.  
In each study and treatment group the rates of fever at baseline were lower (by 20-30 percentage 
points) in those had received prior antibacterial therapy vs. those with no prior therapy within 2 days. 
However, those who had received prior therapy did not have lower rates of SIRS or raised WBC and, if 
anything, rates were slightly higher.    
The rates of pathogen isolation suggested relatively more MSSA in 07 and MRSA in 06. The available 
data on PVL status of S. aureus isolates in the ME population revealed that 44.6% (161/361) were PVL 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 89/122
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
positive, of which 101 were MRSA and 60 were MSSA in the ceftaroline-treated group. In the 
comparator group 43.1% (144/334) were PVL-positive, including 77 MRSA and 68 MSSA. Most MRSA 
(77%) isolates were from US subjects where 91% were of the USA300 clone (rarely seen otherwise). 
It followed that 83% of the US MRSA were of SCCmec type IV but MRSA from other regions were 
distributed among SCCmec types 1-IV. Major abscess was the predominant type of infection among US 
subjects. 
The pooled analyses showed that clinical and microbiological response rates were over 90% for MSSA 
and MRSA and regardless of the presence of PVL-encoding genes in both treatment groups. When the 
data were additionally analysed by type of infection there was some indication that cure rates for MRSA 
were slightly lower than for MSSA at some locations but the same pattern usually applied to both 
treatments.  
MICs of ceftaroline were 0.06 to 0.5 mg/L for MSSA and 0.25 to 2 mg/L for MRSA. The MICs of 
ceftaroline for haemolytic streptococci were very low. There was no relationship detected between MIC 
and outcomes. The cure rates in the co-primary populations were comparable across studies as well as 
treatment groups with approx. 86% MITT and approx. 92% CE subjects cured at TOC. At this visit 
more than 40% had complete resolution of signs and symptoms (with closely comparable rates 
between treatments) while the rest had improved such that no further antibacterial therapy was 
deemed necessary. Cure rates showed relatively small differences according to lesion type and 
location. An analysis of outcomes according to co-morbid conditions showed some small numerical 
differences but these variably favoured ceftaroline or comparative therapy.  
The pooled data underlined that the highest cure rates were reported from Russia and Ukraine and the 
lowest in Latin America. The effect of results from Poland was seen for the pooled comparison of EU 
data between treatments with cure rates of 89% for ceftaroline and 94.7% for comparator. 
Nevertheless, EU cure rates after removing data from the Polish site gave rates of 92.9% and 95.1% in 
respective treatment groups. In the US, where most subjects were enrolled, the cure rates were 
80.5% vs. 76.3% (MITT) and 89.6% vs. 88.3% (CE).   
Outcomes according to subject characteristics showed a small numerical difference in the ceftaroline 
group only with lower cure rates for those aged over 65 years and of female gender but there did not 
seem to be any negative effect of prior failure or prior systemic use on responses to ceftaroline. 
Pooled rates (CE) according to baseline indicators of severity (see below) showed some small 
numerical differences that were almost consistently in favour of comparative treatment. There could be 
many possible factors involved and further exploratory analyses did not lead to any definitive 
conclusions since the numbers in the subgroups were often small.  
The CART analysis suggested that a PK/PD target of 55% T>MIC (free-drug) was significantly 
associated with per-subject microbiological response of monomicrobial or polymicrobial S. aureus 
infections.  However, only 7/431 subjects with S. aureus infections had free-drug %T>MIC values less 
than the CART-derived threshold of 55% so there is high model uncertainty.  
Analysis performed across the two Phase 3 CAP studies 
Due to the treatment regimen imposed there were less than 30 US subjects enrolled at a single study 
site in the entire CAP development programme. The majority of subjects were enrolled in EU countries 
(42-47% per study/treatment group) or in other European countries, among which the applicant 
counts Russia and Ukraine (36-38% per study/treatment group). The summary of severity at 
enrolment based on various parameters, some of which were calculated retrospectively suggests that 
generally comparable populations were enrolled into the two studies. The actual cure rates were very 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 90/122
 
 
 
 
comparable for each treatment across the two studies, suggesting that giving clarithromycin on day 1 
in study 08 did not have a major effect on outcomes for either treatment. The analyses of outcomes 
for those who did and did not have evidence of additional atypical pathogens supported this conclusion. 
However, the clinical failure rates for ceftaroline were lower in study 08 in both co-primary populations 
whereas this pattern was not observed for ceftriaxone. Pooled outcomes by demographics and risk 
classes reflected the individual study data already shown.  
Classifying subjects according to the ATS severe CAP criteria showed CE population cure rates of 82% 
vs. 71% for who did and 85% vs. 81% for those who did not meet the criteria. Rates were 84% vs. 
76% for those meeting the SIRS criteria and 86% vs. 83% for those who did not. In contrast, cure 
rates were not notably different between treatments for those with hypoxia at baseline (78% vs. 
75%), structural lung disease (78% vs. 76%), pleural effusion (68% vs. 66%; note rates for those 
without effusion were 88% vs. 81%) or multilobar pneumonia (78% vs. 76%). 
For current smokers cure rates were 87% for ceftaroline (n=119) and 66% for ceftriaxone (n=105) 
with rates of 89% vs. 81% for those who had never smoked (>200 per group) but for those who were 
not current smokers rates the cure were 74% [n=128] and 82% [n=126].  
Particularly pertinent are the cure rates according to receipt of systemic antibacterial therapy within 
the 96 h prior to randomisation. In each study the cure rates in the two primary populations at TOC 
were comparable (small or no numerical difference) between treatments within the subsets who had 
received prior treatment. In contrast, cure rates were higher for ceftaroline vs. ceftriaxone in each 
study and each analysis population among subjects with no prior treatment. 
The magnitude of the difference between treatments was greater in study 08 than 09. This reflected 
the fact that cure rates were lower for subjects with no prior therapy in each study/treatment group 
with the exception of the ceftaroline group in 08, where cure rates were actually higher in those with 
no prior therapy in the MITTE and CE populations. While 43-47% per treatment/study had a pathogen 
there were 26-31% included in the mMITTE populations. Overall S. pneumoniae accounted for 41.7% 
of patients with a pathogen (24% culture and 18% UAT) while 13/80 cultured were MDRSP (4 
ceftaroline and 9 ceftriaxone group). However, all were susceptible to penicillin except for one in a 
ceftriaxone subject (intermediate). Of the 27 serotypes the most common was serotype 3 (n=8). S. 
pneumoniae also accounted for 31/43 mMITTE subjects with bacteraemia. The highest MIC observed 
with ceftaroline was 1 mg/L.  
Not surprisingly then no relationship could be detected between MIC and outcomes. The PK/PD target 
could not be estimated using CART analysis since 91.1% of CAP subjects had estimated %T>MIC 
ranging from 91.7% to 100% based on unbound drug plasma concentrations. Using the median %T 
>MIC that resulted in stasis, 1-log10 kill, and 2-log10 kill for the various pathogens examined Monte 
Carlo simulation was used to determine PTA. The PTA for S. pneumoniae (MIC 90 0.25 mg/L) was ≥ 
99.5% for all PD targets while PTA for MSSA (MIC90 0.25 mg/L) was ≥ 99.9% for all PD targets. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
There were no clinical studies conducted in special populations. The CHMP asked the applicant during 
this procedure to further justify the use of 600 mg q12h in obese subjects. The applicant explained 
that the basic PK properties of ceftaroline suggest that obesity is not likely to alter the disposition of 
the drug in the body. Clearance of ceftaroline approximates to the GFR and, since renal excretion is the 
major route of elimination, changes in CrCl may influence the PK of the drug. Ceftaroline has low 
plasma protein binding (20%) and a relatively small volume of distribution at steady state (Vd,ss) of 
approximately 16 to 21 L in healthy volunteers, which approximates to the volume of extracellular 
fluid. On this basis obesity would not be expected to alter the ceftaroline PK, since limited distribution

into adipose tissue can be predicted. In the conducted phase 2/3 studies body weight was not found to 
be a statistically significant covariate in the population PK analysis. The final population PK model was 
used to predict the Cmax and AUC of ceftaroline in the phase 3 study patients grouped by BMI. 
Most patients did however not have plasma samples, so exposures were based on population mean PK 
parameters and individual covariates for those patients. The mean steady-state AUC and Cmax values 
within each of the cSSTI and CAP study populations were comparable between patients of normal 
weight compared to those that were morbidly obese. Thus, available data suggest that the 600 mg 
q12h is appropriate for obese patients. There were low numbers of morbidly obese patients (BMI ≥40 
kg/m2) in both the CAP and cSSTI studies.  There was a suggestion of a lower clinical response to 
ceftaroline in morbidly obese patients with cSSTI with 10/39 failing vs. 5/38 such patients treated with 
vancomycin. The clinical response rate was slightly lower in morbidly obese patients with cSSTI in both 
treatment groups. Since the population PK analysis did not indicate an effect of obesity on exposure to 
ceftaroline the applicant considered and CHMP agreed that the finding could reflect variability of the 
response in small subgroups.   
Supportive studies 
There were no supportive studies conducted. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
cSSTI Studies 
The comparator regimen chosen for the cSSTI studies could be accepted by CHMP since the studies 
aimed (and succeeded) in enrolling a high proportion of subjects with MRSA. Justification for the choice 
of this comparator was requested by CHMP in the D120 list of questions and the submitted response 
was deemed acceptable. The routine dose of vancomycin was sufficient although vancomycin levels 
were not routinely collected, apparently because this would have been inconsistent with local practice 
in many areas.  
The aztreonam dose (1g q12h) is that recommended in the US and is lower than that used in the EU 
(1g q8h or 2g q12h). Overall, ~6% of comparator subjects did not receive aztreonam and another 
53% discontinued aztreonam before completing vancomycin therapy. The evaluation of outcomes 
according to mono-, poly and mixed Gram-negative pathogens did not reveal any disadvantage for the 
comparator group and cure rates were very high. Therefore, if the Gram-negative bacteria cultured 
were contributing to the infection there was no evidence that the aztreonam dose or total regimen was 
inadequate. 
The study population was in keeping with that commonly observed in cSSTI studies, noting that some 
types of infections (e.g. diabetic foot infections) were not included. About 30% in study 06 and 40% in 
07 had a major abscess. An analysis of outcomes after excluding all subjects with abscess 
demonstrated comparability between treatments. In 06 the cure rates for those with abscess > 5 cm 
were 65/74 (88%) for ceftaroline and 64/67 (96%) for vancomycin. In 07 the corresponding cure rates 
were 96/103 (93%) vs. 94/100 (94%). The tabulations of surgical interventions showed that 30-40% 
of all subjects per group underwent incision and drainage and it was clarified that ~two-thirds of these 
had an abscess.  
The primary analyses indicated non-inferiority for ceftaroline vs. comparative treatment. While there 
were some imbalances between treatments in terms of numbers of subjects who failed and had 
indeterminate outcomes the analyses in which all such subjects were counted as failures supported 
comparability between treatments.  
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 92/122
 
 
 
 
Analyses included a comparison of outcomes in all treated subjects with any pathogen, which 
demonstrated comparability between treatments. For some individual pathogens the numbers are 
rather small for interpretation. However, there was no instance of a marked difference between 
treatments.   
The analysis of outcomes according to severity of illness scores (derived by the applicant and based on 
that of Wilson, 2003) showed that there was a spread of subject numbers across the four categories 
although the highest numbers were in the lowest score category. Cure rates were broadly comparable 
across the four categories of subjects and also between treatments within each category.  
In this regard, about 30% of subjects had a fever and about one third had an elevated WBC at 
baseline while < 25% had SIRS. These rates may be lower then reported in some other cSSTI studies 
conducted in recent years. Further analyses showed that the rate of fever may have been influenced 
by prior therapy but there was no effect apparent for rates of raised WBC and SIRS. 
The analyses of outcomes according to baseline features such as fever, WBC and both of these with or 
without at least one clinical sign judged to be severe showed some numerical inferiority of cure rates 
for ceftaroline. It remains possible that a higher dose and/or longer infusion time of ceftaroline may be 
needed in patients with very severe systemic upset due to differences in PK (e.g. greater Vd). 
The retrospective analysis in a FDA-defined sub-population of subject status on study day 3 pointed to 
some possible advantage for ceftaroline at this early time point but this was not evident based on cure 
rates at the TOC visit, which were closely comparable between treatments. In particular, the Day 3 
response did not seem to be a good predictor of an outcome of failure in either treatment group.  
CAP Studies 
The study population was appropriate for an intravenous antibacterial agent with the spectrum 
limitations of ceftaroline. PORT class III-IV subjects would fall into the categories for which initial 
intravenous treatment would usually be considered but would not require ICU admission. There were 
some regional differences in cure rates that suggest there was not uniformity of the population 
enrolled. However, further explorations of the data did not detect a consistent relationship between 
outcome and proportion of patients meeting the criteria for SIRS, ATS severe pneumonia or PORT risk 
class. Hence the variations in cure rates that were seen between regions and between countries within 
each region did not consistently correspond to percentages meeting these sets of criteria. 
The two studies employed ceftriaxone 1 g daily as the comparator. No concomitant macrolide was 
administered in study 09 and only two doses of oral clarithromycin were given in study 08. The two 
studies demonstrated non-inferiority for ceftaroline vs. ceftriaxone 1 g daily. Cure rates in the co-
primary analysis populations were only slightly numerically higher for each treatment in study 08 vs. 
study 09. 
There were several features of the analyses that suggested the possibility that the comparative 
regimen of 1 g q24h ceftriaxone was inadequate, which would have threatened the validity of the 
demonstration of non-inferiority. In particular: 
o  The very consistent lower numerical response rates in the ceftriaxone group could not be explained 
by the presence of non-susceptible pathogens since subjects with MRSA were not enrolled or were 
excluded from the analyses and there were very few penicillin-insusceptible strains in the MITTE 
population. In addition, the information on failures in the ceftriaxone group and the supplementary 
tabulations of outcomes according to MICs of baseline pathogens did not suggest a relationship 
between failure and higher MICs.   
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 93/122
 
 
 
 
o  There were several instances where the difference in cure rates between treatments was 
particularly marked for subsets with features suggesting more severe illness compared to subsets 
without these features (e.g. those who met the ATS severe criteria, those with SIRS) that added to 
the concern that the ceftriaxone dose was not adequate for the entire study populations.  
o  The analyses of outcomes according to prior therapy suggested that cure rates were comparable 
between treatments only when there had been pre-study antibacterial therapy.  
o  Although the applicant provided PK/PD analyses in support of ceftriaxone 1 g q24h and pointed out 
the lack of clear evidence for an advantage of 2 g vs. 1 g daily, the results still indicated that the 
adequacy of the selected comparative regimen for PORT III-IV subjects was questionable.  
The current European Respiratory Society (ERS), Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and 
ATS guidelines recommend a β-lactam plus a macrolide or fluoroquinolone monotherapy to treat CAP 
requiring hospitalisation. Ceftriaxone is widely accepted as an appropriate treatment for CAP. The 1 g 
q24h regimen appears in the prescribing information for ceftriaxone with options to give up to 2-4 g 
daily in severe infections. In some guidelines the recommended dose for CAP requiring hospitalisation 
is 2 g q24h or 1 g q24h but with mandated accompanying macrolide.  
The lack of concomitant cover for atypical pathogens per se might not be so important. Several studies 
have suggested that cure rates are very high even when specific cover for C. pneumoniae or M. 
pneumoniae (based on serological evidence of infection) has not been given. In studies 08 and 09 
those thought to have Legionella (based on urinary antigen) were to be excluded. However, while the 
addition of a macrolide is intended to cover atypical pathogens it can also contribute to overall 
treatment effect of the beta-lactam agent for standard pathogens since resistance rates to this class 
(e.g. in pneumococci) remain fairly low in many countries.  
The most important consideration was whether the non-inferiority conclusion made from the two CAP 
studies could be considered robust. The applicant pointed out that to not achieve the pre-specified 
criterion for non-inferiority (LL 95% CI > -10%) based on the ceftaroline cure rates, the ceftriaxone 
arm cure rates would have needed to be 88% to 90% in study 08 in the MITTE and CE populations, 
respectively, and 85% in study 09 (both populations). Ceftaroline would have still shown non-
inferiority even if the comparator response rate had been 8% to 12% higher than that actually 
observed. Such response rates would be in the same range as the highest response rates observed 
with ceftriaxone in published studies and would be higher than expected for PORT risk class III or IV. 
Thus, the applicant proposed that even a very positive view on the cure rate of ceftriaxone still 
supported the conclusion of non-inferiority for ceftaroline vs. ceftriaxone for the treatment of CAP in 
patients with PORT risk class III or IV. On this basis, the demonstration of non-inferiority was accepted 
by the CHMP.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
cSSTI Studies 
The primary analyses indicated non-inferiority for ceftaroline vs. comparator in the treatment of cSSTI. 
While there were some imbalances between treatments in terms of numbers of subjects who failed and 
had indeterminate outcomes the analyses in which all such subjects were counted as failures supported 
comparability between treatments. It remains possible that a higher dose and/or longer infusion time 
of ceftaroline may be needed in patients with very severe systemic upset due to differences in PK (e.g. 
greater volume of distribution). 
Zinforo 
Assessment report

CAP Studies 
The two studies demonstrated non-inferiority for ceftaroline vs. ceftriaxone 1 g daily. Cure rates in the 
co-primary analysis populations were only slightly numerically higher for each treatment in study 08 
vs. study 09. Although the comparative regimen of 1 g q24h ceftriaxone may not have been the most 
appropriate, the applicant’s argument that even a very positive view on the cure rate of ceftriaxone 
would still supports the conclusion of non-inferiority for ceftaroline vs. ceftriaxone for the treatment of 
CAP and on that basis the demonstration of non-inferiority of ceftaroline to ceftriaxone was accepted 
by the CHMP. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety population consists of more than 1700 subjects exposed to at least one dose of ceftaroline 
of which 1470 were treated with ceftaroline for cSSTI or CAP. In the Phase 3 studies 1305 subjects 
received ceftaroline, including 879 dosed for 5-7 days and 236 for 8-10 days. The mean number of 
days dosed was 8.4 in cSSTI studies (92.5% completed) and 6.5 in CAP studies (94.1% completed 
treatment). 
Patient exposure 
The safety population consists of > 1700 subjects exposed to at least one dose of ceftaroline of which 
1470 were treated with ceftaroline for cSSTI or CAP in the 6 Phase 2/3 studies.  
 
In Phase 1 studies 236 subjects were exposed to ceftaroline across 10 studies. The highest 
single dose was 2000 mg while the intended therapeutic dose of 600 mg q12h was given for up 
to 14 days. Most subjects (192/236) received one day of dosing, six ESRD subjects received 
two doses while 38 received 5-14 days.  
  Another 69 subjects were dosed in the NXL104 interaction study and the adolescent PK study. 
 
In the Phase 2 cSSTI studies 165 subjects received ceftaroline of which 98 were dosed IM and 
67 IV. The majority of subjects (120/165) received 5-10 days ceftaroline either IV (45) or IM 
(75). 
 
In the Phase 3 studies 1305 subjects received ceftaroline, including 879 dosed for 5-7 days 
and 236 for 8-10 days. The mean number of days dosed was 8.4 in cSSTI studies (92.5% 
completed treatment) and 6.5 in CAP studies (94.1% completed treatment).  
Adverse events  
In Phase 3 studies 46% ceftaroline and 47% pooled comparator subjects reported at least one TEAE 
with respective treatment group rates of 45% vs. 48% in cSSTI and 47% vs. 46% in CAP studies. 
 
In the cSSTI pool the most common TEAEs in the ceftaroline group were nausea, headache and 
diarrhoea. Pruritus was the only TEAE for which rates differed by 2% and this occurred more 
frequently in the vancomycin group. About 25% subjects per group reported TEAEs of mild 
intensity while ~4% reported severe TEAEs but no single event predominated in this category.  
 
In the CAP pool the most common TEAEs in the ceftaroline group were diarrhoea, headache and 
insomnia and each of these AEs occurred with greater frequency in the ceftaroline group. There 
were no TEAEs for which rates differed by > 2% between treatment groups. About 25% ceftaroline 
and 20% vancomycin subjects reported TEAEs of mild intensity while ~7% per group reported 
severe TEAEs but no single event predominated in this category.  
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 95/122
 
 
 
 
Rates of subjects with at least one TEAEs assessed as related to study drug in the cSSTI pool were 
24% for ceftaroline and 26% for vancomycin. The most common TEAEs related to study drug were 
nausea (3.5% of subjects vs. 3.1%), diarrhoea (3.3% vs. 2.6%), headache (2.5% vs. 2.6%), pruritus 
(2.3% vs. 6.6%) and generalised pruritus (1.7% vs. 2.8%). In the CAP pool the rates of subjects with 
at least one TEAE assessed as related to study drug were comparable between ceftaroline and 
ceftriaxone groups (14.7% vs. 13.2%). The most common TEAEs in both treatment groups were 
diarrhoea (3.1% vs. 1.5%), phlebitis (2.1% vs. 1.1%) and nausea (1% per group). 
In the pooled cSSTI studies the highest subject reporting rates for TEAEs were observed in the US 
(62% ceftaroline and 69% vancomycin) and the lowest in Europe (EU and non-EU; ~ 28% per 
treatment group). In the pooled CAP studies the overall TEAE reporting rates were higher than for 
cSSTI studies. The highest rates were seen for subjects enrolled in Latin America (72% and 68%) and 
the US (62% vs. 85%; but only 13 were enrolled per treatment group) with lower and generally 
comparable rates for Europe (EU and non-EU in the range 39-45%) and rates in Asia of ~57% (only 18 
and 19 subjects per treatment group).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were more deaths in Phase 3 CAP studies (15 [2.4%] ceftaroline and 12 [2%] ceftriaxone) than 
in cSSTI studies (3 and 0) and a small numerical excess in the ceftaroline group within each pooling, 
leading to an overall comparison of 18 (1.4%) vs. 12 (0.9%) for the pooled comparators.

The types of SAEs with fatal outcomes were very scattered in nature and no association between type 
of preceding SAE and treatment group can be discerned from these small numbers.  
In the IV ceftaroline Phase 2 study percentages of subjects with at least one SAE were 4.5% 
ceftaroline and 6.3% vancomycin. SAEs in the ceftaroline group were skin infection, pulmonary 
oedema and gangrene (assessed as unrelated to study drug).  
In the Phase 3 studies, the incidence of SAEs was lower in subjects with cSSTI (4.3% ceftaroline [30] 
and 4.1% vancomycin [28]) compared to subjects with CAP (11.3% ceftaroline [69] and 11.7% 
ceftriaxone [72]). The two studies within each indication showed broadly comparable rates for SAEs 
overall and for individual types of event as far as can be judged given the very scattered nature and 
hence low numbers of subjects per event. The most common SAEs were related to the illnesses 
observed in the study population and most were assessed as not related to study drug. 
In the cSSTI pool, seven subjects (4 ceftaroline) had SAEs assessed by an Investigator to be related to 
study drug and in six cases there was premature discontinuation of study drug or study. In the 
ceftaroline group these cases involved anaphylactic shock, anaphylactoid reaction, hypersensitivity and 
Clostridium difficile colitis. The two cases in the vancomycin group involved hypersensitivity and acute 
renal failure. 
In the CAP pool the most common SAE was pneumonia, which occurred in 9 subjects in each group 
and all represented worsening or relapse of CAP or onset of nosocomial pneumonia while none was 
assessed by an investigator as related to study drug. However, there were 9 subjects (3 ceftaroline) 
who had SAEs assessed by an Investigator to be related to study drug of which 4 (1 ceftaroline) that 
led to premature discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal from study. The ceftaroline case involved 
sudden death in a 73-year-old on day 3 with no notable medical history or baseline laboratory or ECG 
findings. While the investigator considered this was a treatment failure a cardiologist considered that 
myocardial infarction was a possible explanation. 
Laboratory findings 
One Phase 1 subject had neutropenia (1.1 x 109/L) on day 11 with ceftaroline 900 mg q12h and 
NXL104, which recovered by day 12-17. In Phase 2 studies DAGT seroconversion occurred at higher 
rates in ceftaroline groups (22% vs. 5% and 15% vs. 5% in the two studies). Subjects with on-study 
conversion to positive DAGT results did not have evidence of haemolytic anaemia.  
In each of the Phase 3 cSSTI and CAP pools shifts in haematology parameters up to EOT were 
generally comparable between treatments. The number of WBC count shifts from normal to low was 
slightly higher for ceftaroline (4.8% vs. 2.3% in cSSTI; 5.3% vs. 1.6% in CAP) while numbers of 
subjects with low absolute neutrophil count were 3.1% vs. 3.5% in cSSTI and 4.4% vs. 2.4% in CAP). 
Rates for shifts from normal to high absolute eosinophil counts occurred in 2.6% and 1.5% in cSSTI 
studies but there was no difference between treatments in CAP studies (2.6% both groups).   
A further exploration of shifts from normal to low WBC in cSSTI studies showed that: 
 
The lowest WBC count at EOT was 2.44 x 103/μL for ceftaroline vs. 2.8 x 103/μL for comparators 
  Most low WBC counts were just below the lower normal reference range in both treatment groups  
 
In 4/17 ceftaroline and 3/8 comparative patients a low WBC count was documented prior to EOT. 
Two of the 4 in the ceftaroline group had a normal WBC count between D0 and EOT. 
One ceftaroline and two comparator patients with cSSTI had a first low WBC count on Day 3. The 
largest difference was seen at Day 7 with more low WBC counts in the ceftaroline group. The WBC 
Zinforo 
Assessment report

count data were also analysed by each measurement day (i.e. not taking into account the time window 
around each scheduled visit), which confirmed that the earliest low WBC count occurred on D3 and the 
initial low WBC count observation ranged from D3-14 for ceftaroline and from D3-11 for vancomycin 
plus aztreonam. 
Review of the differential WBC counts showed that at EOT there were 10 ceftaroline patients with a low 
neutrophil count (the lowest value was 1270/μL [LLN 1960/μL]). One of the 10 patients also had a low 
lymphocyte count [580/μL; LLN 800/μL] and one other patient had a low lymphocyte count (750/μL). 
In the comparative group five patients had a low neutrophil count (the lowest value was 1570/μL) and 
two had a low lymphocyte count (the lowest value was 460/μL). 
A comparable analysis in CAP studies showed that: 
 
 
The lowest WBC count at EOT was 2.8 x 103/μL for ceftaroline vs. 1.58 x 103/μL for ceftriaxone 
The number of ceftaroline patients with WBC counts at EOT < 3.0 x 103/μL was slightly higher in 
the CAP vs. cSSTI population but no clinically relevant low WBC counts occurred  
 
In 4/13 ceftaroline and 1/4 ceftriaxone patients a prior low WBC count was documented 
Among all those with post-baseline shift from normal to low, 4 ceftaroline and one ceftriaxone patients 
had a first low WBC count on Day 3. The largest difference across treatment groups was seen at Day 7, 
with more low WBC counts in the ceftaroline group. Analysis of the WBC count data by each 
measurement day confirmed that the earliest low WBC count in these subjects was on D3 in both 
treatment groups and the initial low WBC ranged from D3-8 for both treatment groups. 
At EOT a low neutrophil count was noted in 8 ceftaroline patients (the lowest value was 1050/μL). One 
of these also had a low lymphocyte count [740/μL] and a low monocyte count [100/μL; LLN 120/μL]. 
Another four patients had a low lymphocyte count (the lowest value was 510/μL). Four ceftriaxone 
patients had a low neutrophil count (the lowest value was 1050/μL) and one also had a low lymphocyte 
count [270/μL]. 
In Phase 3 studies a DAGT was to be performed at baseline, EOT and TOC visits. The post-baseline 
DAGT positivity rates by subject were 11.6% ceftaroline vs. 4.3% vancomycin in the cSSTI studies and 
9.8% vs. 4.5% in the CAP studies. There were slightly higher baseline DAGT positivity rates in the 
ceftaroline groups (4.6% vs. 3.2% cSSTI and 5% vs. 2.7% in CAP). However, in the CAP studies the 
DAGT conversion rates were 9.4% for ceftaroline vs. 4.3% for ceftriaxone.

Table 27: Potentially clinically significant post-baseline haematology values in phase 2 and 3 
for cSSTI and pahse 3 studies for CAP (safety population) 
The applicant explored the baseline characteristics for those who did and did not show DAGT 
seroconversion. There were some numerical differences for age, gender, race, BMI and pre-existing 
renal impairment but due to the relatively low numbers with seroconversion these numerical 
differences need to be interpreted with caution.  
Additional analyses conducted on concomitant drugs and pre-existing medical conditions that could 
have contributed to DAGT seroconversion did not detect any clustering in the group that 
seroconverted. A review of subjects who did and did not convert to a positive DAGT did not reveal 
clinical or laboratory evidence of haemolytic anaemia. 
In the Phase 3 cSSTI pool, numbers with shifts from normal at baseline to high at EOT were 
comparable across treatment group for aPTT, PT and INR. In the Phase 3 CAP a greater number in the 
ceftaroline group developed a prolonged aPTT (9.3% vs. 4.8%). The percent of subjects who shifted 
from normal to high prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) values was also 
somewhat higher in the ceftaroline group (5.6% vs. 4.2% for INR, 8.9% vs. 7.5% for PT) but the 
differences were small. Six CAP patients had a shift in aPTT to reach > 1.5 x ULN and all were treated 
with ceftaroline. One of the six had a prolonged aPTT on more than one evaluation. However, 4 had 
aPTT values > 150 seconds and two of these patients also had a markedly increased PT 
(>120 seconds) while one had PT=15.7 sec and the other had a normal PT. In the absence of testing 
for coagulation deficiencies or inhibitors it is not possible to determine the cause of the prolongations. 
However, none of the patients had AEs of excessive bleeding.   
In both Phase 2 studies four ceftaroline subjects experienced increases of ALT >3×ULN (1 subject) or 
AST >3×ULN (2 subjects) vs. none for the comparator. The fourth subject experienced AST/ALT 
>3×ULN to reach 197 U/L and 157 U/L, respectively.  
In the Phase 3 cSSTI pool, the number of subjects with liver enzyme shifts from normal at baseline to 
high at EOT was higher in the comparator group. Similarly, in the Phase 3 CAP pool, the number of 
subjects with AST, ALT and GGT shifts from normal at baseline to high at EOT was higher in the 
ceftriaxone group. No subject experienced a SAE or AE representing potential liver injury. 
In the Phase 3 cSSTI pool, the percentages with serum creatinine shifts from normal at baseline to 
high at EOT were 2.3% ceftaroline vs. 1.8% vancomycin) whereas the rates for such shifts was higher 
for BUN in the vancomycin group (0.5% vs. 2.4%). In the Phase 3 CAP pool the percentage with BUN 
shifts from normal at baseline to high at EOT was comparable across treatment groups (3.9% and 
3.7%) while rates for such shifts in serum creatinine were 3.1% vs. 1.8%. Three in the ceftaroline

group had maximum creatinine values > 3 mg/dL but none had SAEs reported that represent potential 
renal impairment and two had pre-existing renal impairment. 
The patients with elevated creatinine were reviewed in detail. Elevations observed in ceftaroline 
patients were mostly of a modest degree and most had slightly declined by the time the last sample 
was obtained. There were no major or consistent differences between the treatment groups. 
Safety in special populations 
Renal impairment 
In Phase 3 the incidence of potential renal impairment TEAEs was 1.5% for ceftaroline and 0.8% for 
comparators. The most frequently observed TEAEs were blood creatinine increased and renal failure. 
SAEs occurred in 4 subjects, including 3 in the ceftaroline group with an SAE of renal failure. One of 
these had considerable renal impairment at baseline, one had onset one week after EOT and the third 
had multiple underlying conditions and an increase in creatinine on therapy (1.3 mg/dL to 2.4 mg/dL).  
Analysis of all non-serious TEAEs of renal failure and/or acute renal failure showed that all subjects had 
significant co-morbid disease and/or were otherwise at high risk for renal failure. An assessment of the 
19 ceftaroline subjects with TEAEs representing potential renal impairment (including the Renal and 
urinary SOC and Investigations SOC) found that 12 did not have post-baseline renal chemistry findings 
that met PCS criteria and one had PCS changes only for BUN. 
Table 28: Incidence of TEAEs indicating potential renal impairment, phase 3 studies for 
cSSTI and CAP (safety population) 
Hepatic impairment 
In Phase 3 studies the overall incidence of any potential liver injury TEAE was low and comparable 
between treatments (2.5% ceftaroline vs. 3.6%) and between cSSTI and CAP populations. Six of the

potential liver-injury TEAEs were considered SAEs (2 ceftaroline, of which one died). A separate 
analysis of all non-serious TEAEs found 5 subjects in the ceftaroline group with hepatitis, hepatomegaly 
or toxic hepatitis. There were no subjects on ceftaroline with data that met potential Hy’s law 
chemistry criteria. Nevertheless, drug-induced liver injury was identified as a potential safety concern 
and shall be monitored by the applicant as per the agreed pharmacovigilance activities.  
Diarrhoea 
In the Phase 1 pool, the incidence of diarrhoea in the ceftaroline group was 2.5% (n=6) vs. 2.6% 
(n=2) for placebo. In Phase 2 studies the rates were 6.1% (n=6) vs. 8.9% (n=4; linezolid) and 4.5% 
(n=3) vs. 3.1% (n=1; vancomycin). In Phase 3 studies the incidence of diarrhoea was slightly higher 
in the ceftaroline group (4.5% vs. 3.2%; similar pattern within each indication). One ceftaroline and 
one ceftriaxone subject had potential treatment-related AAD that resulted in discontinuation. There 
was no requirement for culture or toxin detection tests. C. difficile was identified in a few subjects and 
reported as colitis for 2 ceftaroline and one vancomycin group subject in cSSTI studies with no cases in 
CAP studies. One TEAE of C. difficile colitis in the ceftaroline group was reported as an SAE and 
resulted in premature discontinuation.   
Subject factors 
The overall incidence of TEAEs was higher in female vs. male subjects (by up to 8 percentage points) 
in both Phase 3 cSSTI and CAP pools with apparent difference within the gastro-intestinal and nervous 
system disorders SOCs. In the Phase 3 CAP pool, the overall TEAE incidence was comparable across 
treatment groups for male subjects (44% and 45%) but female subjects showed a higher TEAE 
incidence in the ceftaroline group (52% and 47%). In the Phase 3 cSSTI pool, the overall TEAE 
incidence was slightly lower in the ceftaroline vs. vancomycin group for both genders. 
The differences between genders were most pronounced among females in the ceftaroline group in the 
cSSTI pool (22.9% with a TEAE in Gastrointestinal disorders SOC vs. 9.5% male subjects; 14.5% with 
a TEAE in Nervous system disorders SOC versus 11.7% male subjects). In these SOCs, nausea and 
headache were the most common TEAEs in women and each occurred at a higher incidence in the 
ceftaroline vs. comparator group.  
In the Phase 3 cSSTI pool the incidence of subjects with at least one TEAE in the ceftaroline group was 
only slightly higher for those aged ≥ 65 years vs. < 65 years (47.5% vs. 44.1%, respectively) but the 
older subjects had a lower reporting rate in the vancomycin group (40.8% vs. 49.1%). In the Phase 3 
CAP pool the reporting rates were higher for older subjects in both treatment groups.  
Differences in rates of TEAEs for SOCs by age ≥ and < 65 years varied. Rates were higher in the older 
cohort in both treatment groups for the SOCs cardiac disorders (8.6% ceftaroline and 9.7% 
comparators in subjects ≥ 65 years vs. 3.6% and 2.9% in <65 years), metabolism and nutrition (8.8% 
and 8.0% vs. 4.2% and 5.5%), respiratory (7.1% and 9.7% vs. 3.9% and 5.7%) and vascular (7.8% 
and 7.2% vs. 4.4% and 4.2%). However, no clinically important differences in the incidence of 
individual TEAEs were observed. 
In the Phase 3 cSSTI pool, the incidence of TEAEs was higher among the 18% of total subjects with 
diabetes mellitus (63.1% ceftaroline and 55.8% vancomycin in DM vs. 40.7% and 45.8%, 
respectively). There were five SOCs where the incidence of TEAEs was higher for ceftaroline vs. 
comparator among DM subjects but the small denominators limit these comparisons.

Immunological events 
For the Phase 1 study pool 10 subjects exposed to ceftaroline and none exposed to placebo had a 
potential allergic reaction. These included rash (3), pruritus (3), rash maculopapular (2), dermatitis 
allergic (1), pruritus allergic (1), skin disorder (1), and urticaria (1) and three TEAEs led to 
discontinuation. Co-administration of ceftaroline with NXL104 was associated with several rash events 
and two subjects discontinued. 
In the Phase 2 IM study, 8 (8.2%) ceftaroline subjects had at least one potential allergic TEAE 
compared to none in the linezolid group. In the IV study potential allergic reactions occurred in 3 
ceftaroline and 4 vancomycin subjects. Most common in the ceftaroline group were pruritus and rash 
and two of these subjects discontinued. 
The incidence of potential allergic reactions was higher in the cSSTI (8.8% ceftaroline and 14.7% 
comparator) vs. CAP (1.5% and 1.6%) populations but lower overall for ceftaroline vs. vancomycin 
(5.4% vs. 8.5%) mostly due to pruritus in the vancomycin group. In the cSSTI studies the total rash 
rates were 4.5% for ceftaroline and 5.4% for vancomycin plus aztreonam. However, the potential 
allergic reactions to ceftaroline were quite distinct since they were mostly rashes. Overall, the data 
suggest that there may be an increasing risk of rash the longer ceftaroline is given, which has been 
observed with other antibacterial agents. However, the total rash rates are still quite low and cannot 
be regarded as a major concern provided that the full picture of hypersensitivity reactions to 
ceftaroline is adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
Three SAEs in the ceftaroline group (all in cSSTI studies) included hypersensitivity, anaphylactoid 
reaction and anaphylactic shock, which resulted in discontinuation of drug therapy. Three ceftaroline 
subjects had potential TEAEs of anaphylaxis. One had onset 15 minutes after the start of the first 
infusion with systemic signs and symptoms such as facial swelling, bronchospasm and cyanosis. 
Another had angioedema, a maculopapular pruritic rash that became generalised and a sensation of 
throat closure. The third had a non-serious TEAE of anaphylactic reaction starting 15 minutes after the 
start of the third dose but symptoms were atypical and included acute pain, burning, dizziness, pain in 
chest and facial hyperaemia 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The applicant explored the safety database for TEAEs in Phase 3 study in subjects who took 
concomitant warfarin, furosemide or one of the three most commonly used concomitant medications 
(acetylsalicylic acid, paracetamol and metamizole [dipyrone; banned in much of the EU due to risk of 
agranulocytosis]). In all instances except for metamizole the total AE reporting rates were higher in 
users vs. non-users but mostly comparable between treatment groups (noting 73% ceftaroline vs. 
64% comparators in those who did and 42% vs. 44% in those who did not take furosemide).  
Metamizole was taken by 14.6% (381) and TEAE rates were lower in users vs. non-users in both 
treatment groups (39.8% and 39.0% vs. 46.7% and 48.0%). Further analysis showed that the 
difference was wholly accounted for by the lower TEAE rate in cSSTI studies that was observed in both 
treatment groups. In contrast, in the CAP studies the TEAE rates were higher in metamizole users than 
non-users in both groups. Since the decrease in TEAE rates was noted in only cSSTI studies and it 
occurred in both treatment groups, it seemed likely that the finding does not represent a drug 
interaction between ceftaroline and metamizole. There is no plausible explanation for a real effect to 
occur in only one of cSSTI or CAP studies and the lower rate of TEAEs in subjects treated 
concomitantly with metamizole was thought likely to be a chance finding.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Phase 1 studies 4 subjects exposed to ceftaroline (pruritus, maculopapular rash, urticaria and 
phlebitis) discontinued due to treatment-related AEs. Two others received ceftaroline plus NXL104 and 
discontinued due to a generalised rash on days 8 and 9. In the IV Phase 2 cSSTI study 3 (4.5%) in the 
ceftaroline group discontinued due to gangrene (deemed unrelated), QTc interval prolonged 
(considered related; QTcB 470 ms baseline, 501 ms day 3 and 468 ms 10 days post EOT) and 
mononucleosis syndrome (considered related; unproven virologically and more likely due to drug). 
In Phase 3 studies the most common TEAEs resulting in premature discontinuation of study drug or 
withdrawal from study were potential allergic reactions or were linked to the illnesses seen in the 
population treated (see table 29).  
Table 29: TEAEs by discrete category of rash, hypersensitivity or pruritus which led to 
premature discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal from study in phase 3 studies for 
cSSTI and CAP 
In the Phase 3 cSSTI pool 27 ceftaroline subjects discontinued prematurely compared to 33 
vancomycin subjects while in 17 (4 severe) and 24 (3 severe) subjects in respective groups the TEAEs 
were considered to be treatment-related. In ceftaroline subjects the four severe related TEAEs included 
hypersensitivity, C. difficile colitis, anaphylactoid reaction and anaphylactic shock.   
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 104/122
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the Phase 3 CAP pool 27 (4.4%) subjects in the ceftaroline group and 25 (4.1%) in the ceftriaxone 
group had at least one TEAE that resulted in premature discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal 
from study, including 2 and 3 in respective groups with pneumonia. Five subjects (2 and 3 in 
respective treatment groups) had related TEAEs that were assessed by the Investigator as severe. In 
the ceftaroline group these were cases of sudden death and fatigue. 
Including the SAEs, 15 ceftaroline and 23 comparator subjects had a potential allergic reaction 
considered related to study drug (with 2 exceptions in the comparator group) that led to 
discontinuation. Almost all cases occurred in the cSSTI studies.  
Post marketing experience 
At the time of filing this application ceftaroline was approved only in the US. Ceftaroline was launched 
in the US in January 2011 and post-marketing safety data became available during the assessment 
period. As of 17 June 2011 there had been 17 AEs reported from 14 patients. The most frequently 
reported event was rash (7 reports). All other AEs were reported only once and each occurred in 
different subjects. There were two SAEs of malignant lung neoplasm and anaemia/worsening cellulitis. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Including the SAEs, 15 ceftaroline and 23 comparator subjects had a potential allergic reaction 
considered related to study drug (with 2 exceptions in the comparator group) that led to 
discontinuation. However, almost all cases occurred in the cSSTI studies, in which ceftaroline was 
administered for longer than in CAP studies. This suggests that the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction 
concerning rash or pruritus increases with duration of exposure to ceftaroline.  
The direct antiglobulin test positivity rates were higher with ceftaroline and, specifically, higher than 
observed with the cephalosporin comparator in CAP studies. The total safety database was deemed too 
small to draw any conclusions regarding the possible associated risk of haemolytic anaemia although 
no such risk has been detected thus far. 
Further exploration of imbalances in white blood cells count shifts from normal to low and coagulation 
test shifts (especially for aPTT) did not reveal any obvious explanations for the observations of higher 
rates with ceftaroline. Thus far these changes have not been associated with bleeding events. 
The available post-marketing safety data are still very limited but rash has predominated thus far.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The CHMP agreed that overall the safety profile of ceftaroline does not currently give rise to any major 
concerns.  The several issues needing careful follow-up (C.difficile associated diarrhoea, 
hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis, surveillance of bacterial resistance development, convulsions/seizures, 
potential drug-induced liver injury, haemolytic anaemia, renal impairment) are reflected in the RMP. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the requirements and provides 
adequate evidence that the applicant has the services of a qualified person responsible for 
pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification of any adverse reaction suspected 
of occurring either in the Community or in a third country.

The applicant must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance is in place and functioning before the 
product is placed on the market. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.    
Risk Management Plan 
The applicant submitted a risk management plan, version from , which included a risk minimisation 
plan. The RMP was deemed to be comprehensive and of good quality by CHMP.  The actions proposed 
were considered broadly proportionate to the risks associated with ceftaroline, most of which are 
recognized across the cephalosporin class.

Section 4.4, Special warnings and precautions for use of the SmPC 
contains the following statements:  
Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity reactions are 
possible (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). 
Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity to cephalosporins, 
penicillins or other beta-lactam antibacterials may also be 
hypersensitive to ceftaroline fosamil. Zinforo is contraindicated in 
patients with a history of hypersensitivity to cephalosporins. In 
addition, it is contraindicated in patients with a history of an 
immediate and severe hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylactic reaction) to 
any other type of beta-lactam antibacterial agent (see section 4.3). 
Zinforo should be used with caution in patients with a history of any 
other type of hypersensitivity reaction to penicillins or carbapenems. 
If a severe allergic reaction occurs during treatment with Zinforo, 
the medicinal product should be discontinued and appropriate 
measures taken.

Section 4.1 Theurapeutic indications of the SmPC containsthe 
following statement: 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the 
appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
Section 5.1, Pharmacodynamic properties of the SmPC contains 
susceptibility information by microorganism and also the following 
statement:  
Resistance 
Ceftaroline is not active against strains of Enterobacteriaceae 
producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) from the 
TEM, SHV or CTX-M families, serine carbapenemases (such as 
KPC), class B metallo-beta-lactamases or class C (AmpC) 
cephalosporinases. Organisms that express these enzymes and which 
are therefore resistant to ceftaroline and occur at very variable rates 
between countries and between healthcare facilities within countries.  
If ceftaroline is commenced before susceptibility test results are 
available then local information on the risk of encountering 
organisms that express these enzymes should be taken into 
consideration. Resistance may also be mediated by bacterial 
impermeability or drug efflux pump mechanisms. One or more of 
these mechanisms may co-exist in a single bacterial isolate. 
Product labels will provide information concerning non-susceptible 
organisms and instructions for proper use in an attempt to limit 
bacterial resistance development; however, ceftaroline resistance 
patterns beyond what is known presently, will not become apparent 
until after the launch of the product. Until such time, development of 
resistance will remain an important potential risk rather than an 
identified risk.

The development of a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAGT) may

seroconversion in patients receiving ceftaroline fosamil was 10.7% 
in the pooled  pivotal studies. In clinical studies there was no 
evidence of haemolysis in patients who developed a positive DAGT

Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of ceftaroline in patients with hepatic 
impairment has not been established. As ceftaroline does not appear 
to undergo significant hepatic metabolism, the systemic clearance of 
ceftaroline is not expected to be significantly affected by hepatic 
impairment. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is recommended for 
patients with hepatic impairment.

Section 4.6, Fertility, pregnancy and lactation for use of the SmPC 
contains the following statement: 
There are no or limited data from the use of ceftaroline fosamil in 
pregnant women.  Animal studies conducted in rat and rabbit do not 
indicate harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity at 
exposures similar to therapeutic concentrations. Following 
administration throughout pregnancy and lactation in the rat, there 
was no effect on pup birth weight or growth, although minor 
changes in foetal weight and delayed ossification of the 
interparietial bone were observed when ceftaroline was 
administered during organogenesis (see section 5.3).  .   
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of 
Zinforo during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman 
requires treatment with an antibiotic withZinforo’s antibacterial 
profile.   
Section 5.3, Preclinical safety data of the SmPC contains the 
following statement: 
Reproductive toxicology 
Overall, no adverse effects on fertility or post natal development 
were observed in the rat at up to 5 times the clinical exposure.  
When ceftaroline was administered during organogenesis, minor 
changes in foetal weight and delayed ossification of the interparietal 
bone were observed in the rat at exposures below that observed 
clinically.  However, when ceftaroline was administered throughout 
pregnancy and lactation, there was no effect on pup weight or 
growth. Ceftaroline administration to pregnant rabbits resulted in 
an increased foetal incidence of angulated hyoid alae, a common 
skeletal variation in rabbit foetuses at exposures similarto those 
observed clinically.

The importance of the two above mentioned studies resides in the need to generate data which would 
allow a dosage recommendation in terminally ill renal patients (study D3720C00012) and in 
immunocompromised patients (study D3720C00001), and ultimately the potential use of the product in 
these patients.  
No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information.  
2.8.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Ceftaroline was shown to be non-inferior to the selected comparative regimens in two Phase 3 studies 
in each of cSSTI and CAP. The study populations were adequately representative and the limitations of 
the populations are reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Unlike other cephalosporins, ceftaroline is active in preclinical studies (in vitro and in vivo infection 
models) against MRSA and PNSP due to its ability to bind to the altered PBPs in these organisms that 
commonly confer non-susceptibility to other beta-lactam agents. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Ceftaroline was evaluated against control regimens in a strictly controlled setting and with a 
considerable list of exclusion criteria. There remains some doubt regarding the adequacy of the 600 
mg BID regimen using 60-min infusion times to treat patients with very severe systemic disturbances 
that could impact on PK and therefore on PK/PD and ultimately on efficacy. In addition, this regimen is 
not predicted to cover MRSA that require > 1 mg/L ceftaroline for inhibition and currently perhaps one-
fifth to one quarter of strains have MICs above this cut-off. The applicant is undertaking a comparative 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 119/122
 
 
 
 
study of 600 mg three times dailyin patients with co-morbidities associated with poor outcomes and 
will also monitor resistance in clinical isolates through a resistance surveillance programme. This is 
already included in the agreed risk management plan. 
Ceftaroline has not been evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment so the appropriate dose in 
these patients is not established. The applicant will conduct a study in patients with sever renal 
impairment post-authorisation. 
Ceftaroline has also not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment as the major route of 
elimination is renal. 
Patients with diabetic foot infections were excluded from the cSSTI studies though a proportion of 
patients with diabetes were included so there is limited experience in treating patients with diabetic 
foot infections. 
There is no experience with ceftaroline in the treatment of cSSTI in the following patient groups: the 
immunocompromised, patients with severe sepsis/septic shock, necrotizing fasciitis, perirectal abscess 
and patients with third degree and extensive burns. The applicant has to generate these data through 
the conduct of phase III trial D3720C00001 (see table 33. Additional pharmacovigilance measures to 
be included in the RMP).  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
For the most part the safety profile of ceftaroline in the indications studied was comparable with that 
for the control regimens. As would be expected hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with this 
beta-lactam agent. There is a suggestion that longer duration of therapy may be associated with an 
increased risk of some types of allergic reactions. In addition, seroconversion to positive DAGT status 
has occurred, so far without a link to haemolysis. However, the total safety database is too limited to 
fully assess the risk.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
As already pointed out, certain imbalances were noted for some types of AEs (gastrointestinal: nausea, 
diarrhoea (including C.difficile diarrhoea), hypersensitivity (pruritus, generalised pruritus, 
anaphylactoid reaction), headache)  in the ceftaroline group vs. comparators These will be kept under 
review through the agreed pharmacovigilance measures..   
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Efficacy of ceftaroline has been adequately demonstrated in cSSTI and CAP. Unlike other 
cephalosporins, ceftaroline has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity in the treatment of MRSA and 
PNSP and so may be effective against a proportion of these organisms.  However, clinical experience to 
date is limited. There are no major concerns regarding the safety of ceftaroline. 
Benefit-risk balance 
There are no outstanding issues. The applicant has addressed the D180 LoOI and provided reassurance 
regarding the acceptability of the data following the findings of the GCP inspection.  The benefit-risk 
Zinforo 
Assessment report  
Page 120/122
 
 
 
 
balance is concluded to be favourable for CAP and cSSTI. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The data have demonstrated the benefit of ceftaroline in the treatment of patients with cSSTI and CAP 
although there are some uncertainties whether the benefit is maintained in patients with severe 
infection (severe sepsis/septic shock, necrotizing fasciitis, perirectal abscess) and patients with third 
degree and extensive burns. There are also only limited data on the efficacy of ceftaroline against 
MRSA and PNSP but in vitro and in vivo data suggest ceftaroline is expected to have clinical activity 
against these organisms.  
In general the safety profile of ceftaroline is good with ‘rash’ as the main adverse effect in post-
marketing experience. There is some suggestion that the risk of hypersensitivity reactions may 
increase with length of treatment but as ceftaroline is proposed for short courses this does not 
adversely affect the benefit/risk balance. 
Conclusion 
The overall benefit-risk of Zinforo is positive for use in cSSTI and CAP. 
4. Recommendations

Study design 
This study consisted of 2 phases: 
• Screening – The subject started the study once the Screening assessments were completed and the 
subject was qualified for participation. 
• Treatment – Safety assessments were conducted by the investigator. 
Only subjects who were participating in the designated perampanel study as below and who in the 
opinion of the investigator continued to benefit from treatment with perampanel were eligible for this 
study. Subjects entered this study on the same dose of perampanel that they were receiving at the 
end of their participation in the designated perampanel study - Study 332 (with at least 52 weeks of 
total exposure to perampanel). 
Doses of perampanel and concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were allowed to be adjusted based on 
clinical judgment. A minimum perampanel dose of 2 mg per day was required to continue in the study. 
The maximum daily dose of perampanel permitted was 12 mg per day. 
The visit intervals in this study were every 26 weeks. 
End of study visit was required to be conducted within 3 months from the launch of perampanel in 
Japan.  
For the subjects who did not switch to commercially available perampanel within 3 months after the 
launch of perampanel in Japan, Discontinuation Visit was conducted. 
Subjects who did not tolerate the minimum dose of 2 mg per day during the study were discontinued 
from the study. 
The investigator was allowed to discontinue the subject from the study at any time for safety or 
administrative reasons. When the investigator discontinued the study, Discontinuation Visit was 
conducted. 
A Follow-up visit was conducted 4 weeks after Discontinuation Visit in the discontinued subject. Follow-
up visit was not required once the investigational drug was switched to commercial product.

mg per day was required to continue in the study. The maximum daily dose of perampanel permitted 
was 12 mg per day. 
Batch number: P34001ZZ 
Treatment was continued as long as clinically appropriate according to the judgment of the 
investigator. However, treatment of subjects was completed when perampanel became commercially 
available in Japan. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy 
Not applicable. 
Safety 
Safety was assessed by monitoring of adverse events (AEs), withdrawal from treatment, clinical 
laboratory tests (chemistry), vital signs and weight. 
Other 
Concomitant medication usage. 
Statistical Methods 
Analysis Sets 
Safety Analysis Set included all subjects who signed informed consent, were eligible for this study, 
received at least 1 dose of study medication, and have at least 1 post-dose safety assessment in this 
study. 
Interim Analyses 
Not applicable. 
Efficacy Analyses 
Not applicable. 
Safety Analyses 
All AEs, laboratory parameter, vital signs, and weight were presented in subject data listings. The AE 
verbatim descriptions (investigator terms from the CRF) were classified into standardized medical 
terminology using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Adverse events were 
coded to the MedDRA (Version 19.0) lower level term (LLT) closest to the verbatim term. The number 
(percentage) of subjects with treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) was summarised by system organ class 
(SOC) and preferred term (PT). Summary statistics were presented for laboratory test values, vital 
signs, and weight. 
Other Analyses 
Concomitant AEDs were listed.

The number (percentage) of subjects who took concomitant AEDs at baseline (i.e., at the beginning of 
the Screening Phase of this study was summarized by the AED type (i.e., inducer AED, non-inducer 
AED) and World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO DD) preferred term. 
Sample Size Rationale 
The study was open to all subjects participating in the designated perampanel study (Study 332). 
Results 
Study Conduct and Patient Disposition 
A total of 7 subjects who had participated in the designated perampanel study (Study 332) provided 
informed consent and were enrolled in Study E2007-J000-341 (Study 341). All 7 subjects received at 
least 1 dose of perampanel and were included in the Safety Analysis Set. 
One subject discontinued due to personal choice. 
Study Period: 12 May 2015 to 21 Sep 2016 
This study was continued until perampanel was commercially available in Japan with respect to the 
indication or formulation of the designated study (Study E2007-G000-332). 
Baseline data 
The mean ±SD age was 35.3±19.20 years. Of the 7 subjects, 4 subjects (57.1%) were male, and 3 
subjects (42.9%) were female. The median time since onset of epilepsy was 6.6 years (range: 3 to 57 
years). All 7 subjects were Japanese with tonic-clonic seizures. 
All 7 subjects were taking non-inducer AEDs, while none was taking inducer AEDs. The most common 
AED taken was valproic acid (71.4%). 
Efficacy results 
Not applicable. 
Safety results 
Extent of Exposure 
The mean ±SD cumulative duration of exposure to perampanel was 52.73±7.801 weeks for the Safety 
Analysis Set.  
The mean ±SD average daily dose of perampanel during the study was 8.00±2.828 mg for the Safety 
Analysis Set. The mean ±SD modal dose of perampanel during the study was 8.0±2.83 mg for the 
Safety Analysis Set. Note that each subject received the same doses during the study although doses 
of perampanel were allowed to be adjusted based on clinical judgment. 
The distribution of the dose received by subjects was 6 mg (4 subjects; 57.1%), 8 mg (1 subject; 
14.3%), and 12 mg (2 subjects; 28.6%).

Adverse Events 
TEAEs included those AEs for subjects that entered Study 341 that occurred from the first dose of 
study drug to the last visit of the study, or upto 30 days since the last dose of study drug, whichever 
comes later, or that were present at pre-treatment (baseline of Study 341) but worsened in severity 
during the study. 
At least 1 TEAE occurred in 6 subjects (85.7%) in the Safety Analysis Set during the study. Table 
below presents all TEAEs reported during the study by MedDRA SOC and PT for the Safety Analysis 
Set. The most frequently reported TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (3 subjects; 42.9%). 
Table: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term – Safety 
Analysis Set 
No treatment-related TEAEs were reported during the study. 
All of the TEAEs were considered mild by the investigator, except for 1 moderate TEAE of Fall. 
Only 1 moderate TEAE (fall) occurred in 1 subject during the study.  
No deaths occurred, and no serious adverse events (SAEs) or TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study 
drug were reported during the study. 
Laboratory Results 
There were no clinically important mean and median changes in clinical chemistry laboratory values 
over time for the Safety Analysis Set.  There were no markedly abnormal clinical chemistry laboratory 
values during the study.

Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
There were no clinically important mean and median changes in vital signs and weight over time for 
the Safety Analysis Set. 
There were no clinically notable vital signs during the study. 
Clinically notable reductions in body weight occurred in 1 subject (14.3%), while clinically notable 
elevations in body weight occurred in 3 subjects (42.9%) during the study; however, there were no 
TEAEs of weight increased or weight decreased in the Safety Analysis Set.  
Discontinuations 
Of the 7 subjects treated with perampanel, 1 (14.3%) adult subject discontinued from the study, and 
the remaining 6 (85.7%) subjects completed the study. The primary reason for discontinuation from 
the study reported in the 1 subject was subject choice. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Adjunctive treatment with perampanel daily doses up to 12 mg was safe and well tolerated in this 
study. The adverse events described in Study 341 are consistent with the known safety profile for 
perampanel as well-tolerated adjunctive treatment of epilepsy in the total population as well as in 
adolescents and are already included in the reference safety information (Company Core Data Sheet 
[CCDS] and Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC]). A review of these adverse events does not 
suggest new or unexpected information. There were no significant changes in the frequency and 
severity of previously identified adverse reactions or important/potential risks. 
On the basis of a review of the adverse events and TEAEs in Study 341, no additional changes to the 
CCDS or regional product labelling safety information are considered necessary at this time. The data 
submitted do not affect the benefit-risk balance for perampanel. Perampanel continues to possess a 
favourable benefit-risk profile for the treatment of indicated seizure types.

Summary of the Risk Management Plan  
Summary of the Risk Management Plan for Avelumab (Bavencio) 
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Bavencio. The RMP details important 
risks of Bavencio, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Bavencio’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Bavencio's  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Bavencio should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Bavencio  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this  information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Bavencio’s 
RMP. 
I. 
The Medicine and What it is Used for  
Bavencio is authorized as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic Merkel 
cell carcinoma (MCC) and as first-line maintenance treatment for locally advanced or metastatic 
urothelial carcinoma (UC). In addition, Bavencio in combination with axitinib is approved for the 
first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC; see SmPC for the 
full  indication).  It  contains  avelumab  as  the  active  substance  and  it  is  given  as  an  intravenous 
infusion.  
Further information about the evaluation of Bavencio’s benefits can be found in Bavencio’s EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
webpage:

II. 
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize 
or Further Characterize the Risks  
Important  risks  of  Bavencio,  together  with  measures  to  minimize  such  risks  and  the  proposed 
studies for learning more about Bavencio’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
•  Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
1 
 
•  The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine Risk Minimization Measures. 
In  the  case  of  Bavencio,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  Risk  Minimization 
Measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analyzed,  including  PSUR  (Periodic  Safety  Update  Report)  assessment  -  so  that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine Pharmacovigilance 
Activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Bavencio is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information  
Important  risks  of  Bavencio  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimize  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Bavencio. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

The safety of avelumab was evaluated in clinical trial  EMR100070-003 in 
patients  with metastatic  MCC  (Part  A;  88  patients),  a  large  Phase  1  trial 
EMR100070-001 in patients with various solid tumors (1650 patients). Of 
the  1738  patients  treated  with  avelumab  in  these  studies,  1627  were 
evaluable  for  treatment-emergent  anti-drug  antibodies  (ADA)  and  96 
(5.9%) tested positive including 41 (2.5%) patients who tested positive for 
neutralizing antibodies (nAb). 
Avelumab Single-Agent: B9991001 - UC First-Line Maintenance Treatment 
The  safety  of  avelumab  was  evaluated  in  the  clinical  trial  B9991001  in

Avelumab Single-Agent: EMR100070-001, EMR100070-003 (Part A), and 
B9991001 - Pooled Safety Set  
The safety of avelumab was evaluated in clinical trial EMR100070-003 in 
patients  with metastatic  MCC  (Part  A;  88  patients),  a  large  Phase  1  trial 
EMR100070-001 in patients with various solid tumors (1650 patients), and 
clinical trial B9991001 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC 
as first-line maintenance treatment (344 patients). A total of 2082 patients 
treated with avelumab were evaluated. There were no cases of avelumab 
exposure during pregnancy in these studies. 
The programmed death 1/programed death ligand 1 pathway is thought to 
be  involved  in  maintaining  tolerance  to  the  fetus  throughout  pregnancy. 
Blockade of programed death ligand 1 signaling has been shown in murine 
models  of  pregnancy  to  disrupt  tolerance  to  the  fetus  and to  result  in  an 
increase  in  fetal  loss.  These  results  indicate  a  potential  risk  that 
administration  of  avelumab  during  pregnancy  could  cause  fetal  harm, 
including increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. 
Avelumab in Combination with Axitinib in RCC 
Embryofetal  toxicity  was  not  observed  in  patients  with  RCC  treated  with 
avelumab  in  combination  with  axitinib  in  clinical  trials  B9991002  and 
B9991003. There was 1 case of paternal exposure timing unspecified when 
the wife of a male patient in clinical trial B9991003 became pregnant while 
he  was  receiving  avelumab  in  combination  with  axitinib.  This  event  of 
exposure during pregnancy was not associated with an  adverse event in 
the mother or fetus/child. A healthy baby was born at 36 weeks.

Study  short  name:  Non-interventional  cohort  registry  study  to  assess  characteristics  and 
management of patients with Merkel cell carcinoma in Germany (Study MS100070-0031). 
Rationale and study objectives: 
The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of avelumab in immune compromised patients in 
addition to other objectives, by using real-world data. Within this context, the study aims to:  
1) describe patient characteristics (including co-morbidities and concomitant medications),  
2) estimate background rates of potential safety events (including immune mediated events),  
3) describe treatment patterns, and  
4) characterize disease outcomes (effectiveness and safety).  
Objectives  related  to  effectiveness/  safety  outcomes  will  also  be  assessed  in  the  sub-group  of 
immune  compromised  patients  treated  with  avelumab,  and  an  exploratory  objective  (due  to 
expected limited sample size) will compare these outcomes in immune compromised patients with 
the ones in immune competent patients.

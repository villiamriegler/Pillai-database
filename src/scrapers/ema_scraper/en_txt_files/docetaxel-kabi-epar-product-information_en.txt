treatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The use of docetaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy and it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the 
use of anticancer chemotherapy (see section 6.6). 
Posology 
For breast, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers, premedication consisting of an oral 
corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to 
docetaxel administration, unless contraindicated, can be used (see section 4.4).  
For metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone or 
prednisolone the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours 
and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). 
For metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, irrespective of the concurrent use of prednisone or 
prednisolone, the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg 12 hours, 3 hours, 
and 1 hour before docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). 
Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. 
Docetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks.  
Breast cancer 
In the adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive and node-negative breast cancer, the recommended 
dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 
500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (TAC regimen) (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). 
For the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 in monotherapy. In first-line treatment, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 is given in 
combination therapy with doxorubicin (50 mg/m2). 
In combination with trastuzumab the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 every three weeks, 
with trastuzumab administered weekly. In the pivotal study the initial docetaxel infusion was started 
the day following the first dose of trastuzumab. The subsequent docetaxel doses were administered 
immediately after completion of the trastuzumab infusion, if the preceding dose of trastuzumab was 
well tolerated. For trastuzumab dose and administration, see trastuzumab summary of product 
characteristics.  
In combination with capecitabine, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every three weeks, 
combined with capecitabine at 1250 mg/m2 twice daily (within 30 minutes after a meal) for 2 weeks 
followed by a 1-week rest period. For capecitabine dose calculation according to body surface area, 
see capecitabine summary of product characteristics.  
Non-small cell lung cancer 
In chemotherapy naïve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen 
is docetaxel 75 mg/m2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment 
after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m² as a single 
agent. 
Prostate cancer 
Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer  
The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2. Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily 
is administered continuously (see section 5.1). 
Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Prednisone or 
prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily may be administered continuously. 
Gastric adenocarcinoma 
The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion, followed by cisplatin 
75 mg/m2, as a 1- to 3-hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m2 per 
day given as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion. 
Treatment is repeated every three weeks. Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and 
appropriate hydration for cisplatin administration. Prophylactic G-CSF should be used to mitigate the 
risk of haematological toxicities (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). 
Head and neck cancer 
Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and appropriate hydration (prior to and after 
cisplatin administration). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological 
toxicities. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the TAX 323 and TAX 324 studies, received 
prophylactic antibiotics. 
• 
• 
Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX 323) 
For the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head 
and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion 
followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a 
continuous infusion at 750 mg/m2 per day for five days. This regimen is administered every 
3 weeks for 4 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should receive radiotherapy. 
Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX 324) 
For the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low 
probability of surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour 
intravenous infusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered as a 30-minute to 
3-hour infusion, followed by 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion from day 1 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to day 4. This regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. Following chemotherapy, 
patients should receive chemoradiotherapy. 
For cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose modifications, see the corresponding summary of product 
characteristics. 
Dose adjustments during treatment 
General 
Docetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3. 
In patients who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3 for more than 
one week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel 
therapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 and/or from 75 to 
60 mg/m². If the patient continues to experience these reactions at 60 mg/m², the treatment should be 
discontinued. 
Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer 
Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive docetaxel, doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide (TAC) adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Patients who experience febrile 
neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection should have their docetaxel dose reduced to 60 mg/m² in all 
subsequent cycles (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis should 
have their dose decreased to 60 mg/m². 
In combination with cisplatin 
For patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose 
nadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is < 25,000 cells/mm3, or in patients who 
experience febrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-haematologic toxicities, the docetaxel 
dose in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg/m2. For cisplatin dose adjustments, see the 
corresponding summary of product characteristics.  
In combination with capecitabine 
•  For capecitabine dose modifications, see capecitabine summary of product characteristics. 
•  For patients developing the first appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, which persists at the time of the 
next docetaxel/capecitabine treatment, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, and resume at 
100% of the original dose. 
•  For patients developing the second appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, or the first appearance of 
Grade 3 toxicity, at any time during the treatment cycle, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 
0-1 and then resume treatment with docetaxel 55 mg/m². 
•  For any subsequent appearances of toxicities, or any Grade 4 toxicities, discontinue the docetaxel 
dose. 
For trastuzumab dose modifications, see trastuzumab summary of product characteristics. 
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil 
If an episode of febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection occurs despite 
G-CSF use, the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. If subsequent episodes of 
complicated neutropenia occur the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 60 to 45 mg/m2. In case of 
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. Patients should 
not be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until neutrophils recover to a level 
>1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level >100,000 cells/mm3. Discontinue treatment if these 
toxicities persist (see section 4.4).

For cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose adjustments, see the corresponding summary of product 
characteristics. 
In the pivotal SCCHN studies patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged 
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide 
prophylactic coverage (eg, day 6-15) in all subsequent cycles. 
Special populations 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Based on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/m² as single agent, patients who have both 
elevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal 
range (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of 
docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin > ULN and/or 
ALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase > 6 times the ULN, no 
dose-reduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. 
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric 
adenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 × ULN 
associated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 × ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no 
dose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No 
data are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other 
indications.  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of DOCETAXEL KABI in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged 
1 month to less than 18 years have not yet been established. 
There is no relevant use of DOCETAXEL KABI in the paediatric population in the indications breast 
cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma and head and neck cancer, not 
including type II and III less differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 
Elderly 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in the elderly. 
In combination with capecitabine, for patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of 
capecitabine to 75% is recommended (see capecitabine summary of product characteristics). 
Method of administration 
For instructions on preparation and administration of the product, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with baseline neutrophil count of < 1,500 cells/mm3. 
Patients with severe liver impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Contraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
For breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as 
dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel 
administration, unless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well 
as the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral 
dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2). 
Haematology 
Neutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median 
of 7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of 
complete blood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be 
retreated with docetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). 
In the case of severe neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of 
docetaxel therapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate 
symptomatic measures are recommended (see section 4.2). 
In patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile 
neutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic 
G-CSF. Patients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of 
complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). 
Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
In patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), 
febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received 
primary G-CSF prophylaxis. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive 
adjuvant therapy with TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile 
neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TAC should be 
closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Gastrointestinal reactions 
Caution is recommended for patients with neutropenia, particularly at risk for developing 
gastrointestinal complications. Although majority of cases occurred during the first or second cycle of 
docetaxel containing regimen, enterocolitis could develop at any time, and could lead to death as early 
as on the first day of onset. Patients should be closely monitored for early manifestations of serious 
gastrointestinal toxicity (see sections 4.2, 4.4 Haematology, and 4.8). 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and 
second infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation 
of the infusion of docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should 
be available. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised 
cutaneous reactions do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe 
hypotension, bronchospasm or generalised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of 
docetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions 
should not be re-challenged with docetaxel. Patients who have previously experienced a 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel may be at risk to develop hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel, 
including more severe hypersensitivity reaction. These patients should be closely monitored during 
initiation of docetaxel therapy. 
Cutaneous reactions 
Localised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema 
followed by desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by 
desquamation which lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see 
section 4.2). 
Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic 
Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) have been 
reported with docetaxel treatment. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of 
serious skin manifestations and closely monitored. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions 
appear discontinuation of docetaxel should be considered. 
Fluid retention 
Patients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be 
monitored closely. 
Respiratory disorders 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, 
pulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure have been reported and may be associated with fatal 
outcome. Cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant 
radiotherapy. 
If new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop, patients should be closely monitored, promptly 
investigated, and appropriately treated. Interruption of docetaxel therapy is recommended until 
diagnosis is available. Early use of supportive care measures may help improve the condition. The 
benefit of resuming docetaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated. 
Patients with liver impairment 
In patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels 
(ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels 
greater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as 
toxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, 
infections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel 
in those patients with elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m2 and LFTs should be measured at 
baseline and before each cycle (see section 4.2). 
For patients with serum bilirubin levels > ULN and/or ALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN concurrent 
with serum alkaline phosphatase levels > 6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended 
and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. 
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric 
adenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 × ULN 
associated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 × ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no 
dose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No 
data are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other 
indications.  
Patients with renal impairment 
There are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nervous system 
The development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2). 
Cardiac toxicity 
Heart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, 
particularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may 
be moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8). 
When patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they 
should undergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during 
treatment (e.g. every three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For 
more details see summary of product characteristics of trastuzumab.  
Ventricular arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia (sometimes fatal) has been reported in 
patients treated with docetaxel in combination regimens including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and/ or 
cyclophosphamide (see section 4.8).  
Baseline cardiac assessment is recommended.   
Eye disorders 
Cystoid macular oedema (CMO) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with 
impaired vision should undergo a prompt and complete ophthalmologic examination. In case CMO is 
diagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated (see section 
4.8). 
Second primary malignancies 
Second primary malignancies have been reported when docetaxel was given in combination with 
anticancer treatments known to be associated with second primary malignancies.  Second primary 
malignancies (including acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma) may occur several months or years after docetaxel-containing therapy. Patients should be 
monitored for second primary malignancies (see section 4.8). 
Tumour Lysis Syndrome 
Tumour lysis syndrome has been reported with docetaxel after the first or the second cycle (see section 
4.8). Patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome (e.g. with renal impairment, hyperuricemia, bulky 
tumour, rapid progression) should be closely monitored. Correction of dehydration and treatment of 
high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of treatment. 
Others 
Women of childbearing potential must use contraceptive measures during treatment and for 2 months 
after cessation of treatment with docetaxel. Men must use contraceptive measures during treatment 
and for 4 months after cessation of treatment with docetaxel (see section 4.6). 
The concomitant use of docetaxel with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and 
voriconazole) should be avoided (see section 4.5). 
Additional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer 
Complicated neutropenia 
For patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or 
infection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). 
Gastrointestinal reactions 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Symptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, 
may be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated 
promptly. 
Congestive heart failure (CHF) 
Patients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the 
follow up period. In patients treated with the TAC regimen for node positive breast cancer, the risk of 
CHF has been shown to be higher during the first year after treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Patients with 4+ nodes 
As the benefit observed in patient with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on disease-free 
survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with 4+ 
nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis (see section 5.1). 
Elderly 
Cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer 
There are limited data available in patients > 70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with 
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. 
Cautions for use in castration-resistant prostate cancer 
Of the 333 patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks in a prostate cancer study (TAX 327), 
209 patients were 65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients 
treated with docetaxel every three weeks, the incidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate 
≥ 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients. The 
incidence of related fever, diarrhoea, anorexia, and peripheral oedema occurred at rates ≥ 10% higher 
in patients who were 75 years of age or greater versus less than 65 years. 
Cautions for use in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
Of the 545 patients treated with docetaxel every 3 weeks in a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer study 
(STAMPEDE), 296 patients were 65 years of age or older, and 48 patients were 75 years of age or 
older. More patients aged ≥65 years in the docetaxel arm reported hypersensitivity reaction, 
neutropenia, anaemia, fluid retention, dyspnea, and nail changes when compared to the patients aged 
less than 65 years. None of these increases in frequency reached 10% difference with the control arm. 
In patients who were 75 years of age or older, when compared to younger patients, neutropenia, 
anaemia, diarrhea, dyspnea and upper respiratory tract infection were reported with a greater incidence 
(at least 10% higher).  
Cautions for use in gastric adenocarcinoma cancer 
Among the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) 
patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer 
study, 74 were 65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of 
serious adverse events was higher in older people compared to younger patients. The incidence of the 
following adverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection occurred at rates 
≥ 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients. 
Elderly treated with TCF should be closely monitored. 
Excipients 
This medicine contains 395 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each 1 ml which is equivalent to 39.5% w/v. 
The amount in 9 ml of dose is equivalent to 88.9 ml of beer and 35.6 ml of wine. 
Harmful for those suffering from alcoholism. 
To be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women, children and high-risk groups 
such as patients with liver disease, or epilepsy. 
Because this medicine is usually given slowly over 1 hours, the effects of alcohol may be reduced.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may alter the effects of other medicinal products. 
Co-administration with medicines containing e.g.propylene glycol or ethanol may lead to 
accumulation of ethanol and induce adverse effects, in particular in young children with low or 
immature metabolic capacity. 
In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant 
administration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the 
enzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as ciclosporine, ketoconazole and erythromycin. As 
a result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with these medicinal products as 
concomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction. 
In case of combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors, the occurrence of docetaxel adverse reactions may 
increase, as a result of reduced metabolism. If the concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin and voriconazole) cannot be avoided, a close clinical surveillance is warranted and a 
dose-adjustment of docetaxel may be suitable during the treatment with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor 
(see section 4.4). In a pharmacokinetic study with 7 patients, the co-administration of docetaxel with 
the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole leads to a significant decrease in docetaxel clearance by 
49%. 
Docetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic 
prostate cancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4. 
No statistically significant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. 
Docetaxel is highly protein bound (> 95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with 
concomitantly administered medicinal product has not been investigated formally, in vitro interactions 
with tightly protein-bound agents such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, propafenone, 
phenytoin, salicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein binding of 
docetaxel. In addition, dexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. Docetaxel did not 
influence the binding of digitoxin. 
The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their 
co-administration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction 
between docetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was 
about 50% higher than values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/ Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential and men receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming 
pregnant, and not to father a child and to inform the treating physician immediately should this occur.  
Due to the genotoxic risk of docetaxel (see section 5.3), women of childbearing potential must 
useeffective method of contraception during treatment and for 2 months after cessation of treatment 
with docetaxel. Men must use effective method of contraception during treatment and for 4 months 
after cessation of treatment with docetaxel. 
Pregnancy 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be 
both embryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats. As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, 
docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Therefore, docetaxel must 
not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated.  
Breast-feeding 
Docetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. 
Consequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be 
discontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy. 
Fertility 
Studies in animals have shown that docetaxel may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). Therefore, 
males being treated with docetaxel must seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. The amount of 
alcohol in this medicinal product and the side effects of the product may impair the ability to drive or 
use machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Therefore, patients should be warned of the potential impact 
of the amount of alcohol and the side effects of this medicinal product on the ability to drive or use 
machines, and be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience these side effects during 
treatment. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile for all indications 
The adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel 
have been obtained in: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
1,312 and 121 patients who received 100 mg/m² and 75 mg/m² of docetaxel as a single agent 
respectively. 
258 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin. 
406 patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin. 
92 patients treated with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab. 
255 patients who received docetaxel in combination with capecitabine. 
332 patients (TAX327) who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 
(clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). 
1,276 patients (744 and 532 in TAX 316 and GEICAM 9805 respectively) who received 
docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (clinically important 
treatment related adverse events are presented). 
300 gastric adenocarcinoma patients (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 
79 patients in the phase II part) who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 
5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). 
174 and 251 head and neck cancer patients who received docetaxel in combination with 
cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). 
545 patients (STAMPEDE study) who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or 
prednisolone and ADT. 
These reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; 
grade 3-4 = G3/4; grade 4 = G4), the COSTART and the MedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined as: 
very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available 
data). 
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was 
reversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe 
neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea 
and asthenia. The severity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in 
combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. 
For combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in ≥ 10% are displayed. There 
was an increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the 
trastuzumab combination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. 
For combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects (≥ 5%) 
reported in a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see 
capecitabine summary of product characteristics). 
For combination with ADT and with prednisone or prednisolone (STAMPEDE study), adverse events 
occurring over the 6 cycles of treatment with docetaxel and having at least 2% higher incidence in the 
docetaxel treatment arm by comparison to the control arm, are presented, using the CTCAE grading 
scale. 
The following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel:  
Immune system disorders 
Hypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the 
infusion of docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms 
were flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills. 
Severe reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized 
rash/erythema (see section 4.4). 
Nervous system disorders 
The development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4). Mild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paraesthesia, dysesthesia or pain 
including burning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Reversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to 
moderate. Reactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and 
hands (including severe hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently 
associated with pruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. 
Less frequently, severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to 
interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe 
nail disorders are characterised by hypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyper pigmentation, inflammation, 
redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis or extravasation and swelling of the vein.  
Fluid retention includes events such as peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, 
pericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain. The peripheral oedema usually starts at the lower 
extremities and may become generalised with a weight gain of 3 kg or more. Fluid retention is 
cumulative in incidence and severity (see section 4.4).

Description of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for DOCETAXEL KABI 100 mg/m² single 
agent 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Rare: bleeding episodes associated with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia.  
Nervous system disorders 
Reversibility data are available among 35.3% of patients who developed neurotoxicity following 
docetaxel treatment at 100 mg/m² as single agent. The events were spontaneously reversible within 
3 months. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Very rare: one case of alopecia non-reversible at the end of the study. 73% of the cutaneous reactions 
were reversible within 21 days. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation was more than 1,000 mg/m2 and the median 
time to fluid retention reversibility was 16.4 weeks (range 0 to 42 weeks). The onset of moderate and 
severe retention is delayed (median cumulative dose: 818.9 mg/m2) in patients with premedication 
compared with patients without premedication (median cumulative dose: 489.7 mg/m2); however, it 
has been reported in some patients during the early courses of therapy.

Description of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for DOCETAXEL KABI 100 mg/m² in 
combination with trastuzumab 
Cardiac disorders 
Symptomatic cardiac failure was reported in 2.2% of the patients who received docetaxel plus 
trastuzumab compared to 0% of patients given docetaxel alone. In the docetaxel plus trastuzumab arm, 
64% had received a prior anthracycline as adjuvant therapy compared with 55% in the docetaxel arm 
alone. 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Very common: Haematological toxicity was increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and 
docetaxel, compared with docetaxel alone (32% grade 3/4 neutropenia versus 22%, using 
NCI-CTC criteria). Note that this is likely to be an underestimate since docetaxel alone at a 
dose of 100 mg/m2 is known to result in neutropenia in 97% of patients, 76% grade 4, based 
on nadir blood counts. The incidence of febrile neutropenia/neutropenic sepsis was also 
increased in patients treated with Herceptin plus docetaxel (23% versus 17% for patients 
treated with docetaxel alone).

Second primary malignancies (frequency not known), including non-Hodgkin lymphoma have been 
reported in association with docetaxel when used in combination with other anticancer treatments 
known to be associated with second primary malignancies. Acute myeloid leukaemia and 
myelodysplastic syndrome have been reported (frequency uncommon) in pivotal clinical studies in 
breast cancer with TAC regimen. 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Bone marrow suppression and other haematologic adverse reactions have been reported. Disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multi-organ failure, has been

Hypersensitivity reactions (frequency not known) have been reported with docetaxel in patients who 
previously experienced hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel. 
Nervous system disorders 
Rare cases of convulsion or transient loss of consciousness have been observed with docetaxel 
administration. These reactions sometimes appear during the infusion of the medicinal product. 
Eye disorders 
Very rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring 
during infusion of the medicinal product and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been 
reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of lacrimation with or 
without conjunctivitis, as cases of lacrimal duct obstruction resulting in excessive tearing have been 
rarely reported. Cases of cystoid macular oedema (CMO) have been reported in patients treated with 
docetaxel.  
28 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ear and labyrinth disorders 
Rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing impaired and/or hearing loss have been reported. 
Cardiac disorders 
Rare cases of myocardial infarction have been reported. 
Ventricular arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia (frequency not known), sometimes fatal, has 
been reported in patients treated with docetaxel in combination regimens including doxorubicin, 5-
fluorouracil and/ or cyclophosphamide. 
Vascular disorders 
Venous thromboembolic events have rarely been reported. 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome and cases of interstitial pneumonia/ pneumonitis, interstitial lung 
disease, pulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure sometimes fatal have rarely been reported. Rare 
cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Rare cases of enterocolitis, including colitis, ischemic colitis, and neutropenic enterocolitis, have been 
reported with a potential fatal outcome (frequency not known). 
Rare occurrences of dehydration have been reported as a consequence of gastrointestinal events 
including enterocolitis and gastrointestinal perforation.  
Rare cases of ileus and intestinal obstruction have been reported. 
Hepatobiliary disorders 
Very rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, 
have been reported. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus, bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme and severe 
cutaneous adverse reactions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis 
(TEN) and Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with docetaxel.  
Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphoedema have been reported with 
docetaxel. Cases of permanent alopecia (frequency not known) have been reported. 
Renal and urinary disorders 
Renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported. In about 20% of these cases there were no 
risk factors for acute renal failure such as concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products and 
gastrointestinal disorders. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Radiation recall phenomena have rarely been reported. 
Injection site recall reaction (recurrence of skin reaction at a site of previous extravasation following 
administration of docetaxel at a different site) has been observed at the site of previous extravasation 
(frequency not known). 
Fluid retention has not been accompanied by acute episodes of oliguria or hypotension. Dehydration 
and pulmonary oedema have rarely been reported. 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
Cases of electrolyte imbalance have been reported. Cases of hyponatraemia have been reported, 
mostly associated with dehydration, vomiting and pneumonia. Hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and 
hypocalcaemia were observed, usually in association with gastrointestinal disorders and in particular 
with diarrhoea. Tumour lysis syndrome, potentially fatal, has been reported (frequency not known). 
Musculoskeletal disorder 
Myositis has been reported with docetaxel (frequency not known).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There were a few reports of overdose. There is no known antidote for docetaxel overdose. In case of 
overdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and vital functions closely monitored. In 
cases of overdose, exacerbation of adverse events may be expected. The primary anticipated 
complications of overdose would consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity and 
mucositis. Patients should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose. 
Other appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken, as needed.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, plant alkaloids and other natural products, taxanes, 
ATC Code: L01CD02  
Mechanism of action 
Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable 
microtubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The 
binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. 
Docetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for 
vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and 
against freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular 
concentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some 
but not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance 
gene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental anti-tumour 
activity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Breast cancer 
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide: adjuvant therapy 
Patients with operable node-positive breast cancer (TAX 316) 
Data from a multi-centre open-label randomised study support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant 
treatment of patients with operable node-positive breast cancer and KPS ≥ 80%, between 18 and 
70 years of age. After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 
4+), 1491 patients were randomised to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after 
doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2

followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FAC arm). Both regimens 
were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, 
all other medicinal products were given as intravenous bolus on day one. G-CSF was administered as 
secondary prophylaxis to patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, 
prolonged neutropenia, or infection). Patients on the TAC arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with 
ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. In 
both arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with positive oestrogen and/or progesterone 
receptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed 
according to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 69% of patients who 
received TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC. Two interim analyses and one final analysis 
were performed. The first interim analysis was planned 3 years after the date when half of study 
enrolment was done. The second interim analysis was done after 400 DFS events had been recorded 
overall, which led to a median follow-up of 55 months. The final analysis was performed when all 
patients had reached their 10-year follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow 
up before). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) 
was the secondary efficacy endpoint. 
A final analysis was performed with an actual median follow up of 96 months. Significantly longer 
disease-free survival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. Incidence of 
relapses at 10 years was reduced in patients receiving TAC compared to those who received FAC 
(39% versus 45%, respectively) i.e. an absolute risk reduction by 6% (p = 0.0043). Overall survival at 
10 years was also significantly increased with TAC compared to FAC (76% versus 69%, respectively) 
i.e. an absolute reduction of the risk of death by 7% (p = 0.002). As the benefit observed in patients 
with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on DFS and OS, the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC 
in patients with 4+ nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis. 
Overall, the study results demonstrate a positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC.

Patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy (GEICAM 9805) 
Data from a multi-centre open- label randomised trial support the use of DOCETAXEL KABI for the 
adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive 
chemotherapy. 1060 patients were randomised to receive either DOCETAXEL KABI 75 mg/m2 
administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (539 patients in 
TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 
500 mg/m2 (521 patients in FAC arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable node-negative breast cancer 
patients with high risk of relapse according to 1998 St. Gallen criteria (tumour size > 2 cm and/or 
negative ER and PR and/or high histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and /or age < 35 years).). 
Both regimens were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. DOCETAXEL KABI was 
administered as a 1-hour infusion, all other medicinal products were given intraveinously on day 1

every three weeks. Primary prophylactic G-CSF was made mandatory in TAC arm after 230 patients 
were randomised. The incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection 
was decreased in patients who received primary G-CSF prophylaxis (see section 4.8). In both arms, 
after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ tumours received tamoxifen 
20 mg once a day for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was administered according to 
guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 57.3% of patients who received TAC 
and 51.2% of patients who received FAC. 
One primary analysis and one updated analysis were performed. The primary analysis was done when 
all patients had a follow-up of greater than 5 years (median follow-up time of 77 months). The updated 
analysis was performed when all patients had reached their 10-year (median follow up time of 10 
years and 5 months) follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow-up 
previously). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) 
was the secondary efficacy endpoint. 
At the median follow-up time of 77 months, significantly longer disease-free survival for the TAC arm 
compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in the risk of 
relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), p = 0.01). At the 
median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 16,5% reduction in the 
risk of relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% CI (0.65-1.08), 
p=0.1646). DFS data were not statistically significant but were still associated with a positive trend in 
favour of TAC 
At the median follow-up time of 77 months overall survival (OS) was longer in the TAC arm with 
TAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk of death compared to FAC (hazard ratio = 
0.76, 95% CI (0.46-1.26, p = 0.29). However, the distribution of OS was not significantly different 
between the 2 groups. 
At the median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 9% reduction in 
the risk of death compared to FAC-treated patients (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% CI (0.63-1.32)). The 
survival rate was 93.7% in the TAC arm and 91.4 % in the FAC arm, at the 8-year follow-up time 
point, and 91.3 % in the TAC arm and 89 % in the FAC arm, at the 10-year follow-up time point. 
The positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC remained unchanged 
TAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were 
analyzed in the primary analysis (at the median follow-up time of 77 months) (see table below):

DOCETAXEL KABI as single agent 
Two randomised phase III comparative studies, involving a total of 326 alkylating or 
392 anthracycline failure metastatic breast cancer patients, have been performed with docetaxel at the 
recommended dose and regimen of 100 mg/m² every 3 weeks. 
In alkylating-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to doxorubicin (75 mg/m² every 3 weeks). 
Without affecting overall survival time (docetaxel 15 months vs. doxorubicin 14 months, p = 0.38) or 
time to progression (docetaxel 27 weeks vs. doxorubicin 23 weeks, p = 0.54), docetaxel increased 
response rate (52% vs. 37%, p = 0.01) and shortened time to response (12 weeks vs. 23 weeks, 
p= 0.007). Three docetaxel patients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas 
15 doxorubicin patients (9%) discontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart 
failure). 
In anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and 
vinblastine (12 mg/m² every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m² every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate 
(33% vs. 12%, p < 0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p = 0.0004) and 
prolonged overall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p = 0.01). 
During these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety profile 
observed in phase II studies (see section 4.8).

An open-label, multi-centre, randomised phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel 
monotherapy and paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous 
therapy should have included an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomised to receive 
either docetaxel monotherapy 100 mg/m² as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m² as a 3 hour 
infusion. Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks. 
Without affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p = 0.10), docetaxel 
prolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p < 0.01) and median survival 
(15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p = 0.03). 
More grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to 
paclitaxel (23.0%). 
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with doxorubicin 
One large randomised phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic 
disease, has been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/m²) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m²) 
(AT arm) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/m²) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m²) (AC 
arm). Both regimens were administered on day 1 every 3 weeks.  
•  Time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.0138. 
The median TTP was 37.3 weeks (95% CI: 33.4 - 42.1) in AT arm and 31.9 weeks (95% CI: 27.4 - 
36.0) in AC arm.  
•  Overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.009. 
The ORR was 59.3% (95% CI: 52.8 - 65.9) in AT arm versus 46.5% (95% CI: 39.8 - 53.2) in AC 
arm.  
In this study, AT arm showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile 
neutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), infection (8% versus 2.4%), diarrhoea (7.5% versus 1.4%), asthenia 
(8.5% versus 2.4%), and pain (2.8% versus 0%) than AC arm. On the other hand, AC arm showed a 
higher incidence of severe anaemia (15.8% versus 8.5%) than AT arm, and, in addition, a higher 
incidence of severe cardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF 
decrease ≥ 20% (13.1% versus 6.1%), absolute LVEF decrease ≥ 30% (6.2% versus 1.1%). Toxic 
deaths occurred in 1 patient in the AT arm (congestive heart failure) and in 4 patients in the AC arm 
(1 due to septic shock and 3 due to congestive heart failure).  
In both arms, quality of life measured by the EORTC questionnaire was comparable and stable during 
treatment and follow-up.  
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with trastuzumab 
Docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab was studied for the treatment of patients with metastatic 
breast cancer whose tumours overexpress HER2, and who previously had not received chemotherapy 
for metastatic disease. One hundred eighty six patients were randomised to receive docetaxel 
(100 mg/m2) with or without trastuzumab; 60% of patients received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant 
chemotherapy. Docetaxel plus trastuzumab was efficacious in patients whether or not they had 
received prior adjuvant anthracyclines. The main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in 
this pivotal study was immunohistochemistry (IHC). A minority of patients were tested using 
fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). In this study, 87% of patients had disease that was IHC 3+, 
and 95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC 3+ and/or FISH positive. Efficacy results are 
summarized in the following table:

DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with capecitabine 
Data from one multi-centre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical study support the use of 
docetaxel in combination with capecitabine for treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy, including an anthracycline. In this 
study, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous 
infusion every 3 weeks) and capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week 
rest period). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/m2 as a 1 hour 
intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine 
combination arm (p = 0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 352 days 
(docetaxel alone). The overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator 
assessment) were 41.6% (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to 
progressive disease was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine combination arm (p < 0.0001). The 
median time to progression was 186 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
Patients previously treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy 
In a phase III study, in previously treated patients, time to progression (12.3 weeks versus 7 weeks) 
and overall survival were significantly longer for docetaxel at 75 mg/m² compared to Best Supportive 
Care. The 1-year survival rate was also significantly longer in docetaxel (40%) versus BSC (16%). 
There was less use of morphinic analgesic (p < 0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p < 0.01), other 
disease-related medicinal products (p = 0.06) and radiotherapy (p < 0.01) in patients treated with 
docetaxel at 75 mg/m² compared to those with BSC.  
The overall response rate was 6.8% in the evaluable patients, and the median duration of response was 
26.1 weeks.  
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with platinum agents in chemotherapy-naïve patients 
In a phase III study, 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or 
greater, and who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either 
docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/m2 over 
30-60 minutes every 3 weeks (TCis), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with 
carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/ml.min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/m2 
administered over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on 
day 1 of cycles repeated every 4 weeks (VCis).

Prostate cancer 
Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone in patients with 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were evaluated in a randomised multi-centre phase III 
study (TAX 327). A total of 1006 patients with KPS ≥ 60 were randomised to the following treatment 
groups:  
•  Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. 
•  Docetaxel 30 mg/m2 administered weekly for the first 5 weeks in a 6 week cycle for 5 cycles. 
•  Mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. 
All 3 regimens were administered in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily, 
continuously. 
Patients who received docetaxel every three weeks demonstrated significantly longer overall survival 
compared to those treated with mitoxantrone. The increase in survival seen in the docetaxel weekly 
arm was not statistically significant compared to the mitoxantrone control arm. Efficacy endpoints for 
the docetaxel arms versus the control arm are summarized in the following table:

Given the fact that docetaxel every week presented a slightly better safety profile than docetaxel every 
3 weeks, it is possible that certain patients may benefit from docetaxel every week.  
No statistical differences were observed between treatment groups for Global Quality of Life. 
Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
STAMPEDE study 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel administered concomitantly with standard of care (ADT) in 
patients with high-risk locally advanced or metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer were 
evaluated in a randomised multi-centre, multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) study with a seamless phase 
II/III design (STAMPEDE – MRC PR08). A total of 1776 male patients were allocated to the 
treatment arms of interest:  
•  Standard of care + docetaxel 75 mg/m², administered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles 
•  Standard of care alone  
Docetaxel regimen was administered in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily 
continuously.  
Among the 1776 randomised patients 1086 (61%) had metastatic disease, 362 were randomised to 
docetaxel in combination with standard of care, 724 received standard of care alone.  
In these metastatic prostate cancer patients, the median overall survival was significantly longer in 
docetaxel treatment groups than in the standard of care alone group, with a median overall survival 19 
months longer with the addition of docetaxel to standard of care (HR =  0.76, 95% CI = 0.62-0.92, 
p=0.005).  
Efficacy results in metastatic prostate cancer patients for docetaxel arm versus control arm are

CHAARTED study 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel administered at the beginning of androgen-deprivation therapy 
(ADT) in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer were evaluated in a randomised 
Phase III multi-centre study (CHAARTED). A total of 790 male patients were allocated to the 2 
treatment groups.  
•  ADT + docetaxel 75 mg/m² given at the beginning of ADT, administered every 3 weeks 
for 6 cycles 
•  ADT alone   
The median overall survival was significantly longer in docetaxel treatment group than in the ADT 
alone group, with a median overall survival 13.6 months longer with the addition of docetaxel to ADT

Gastric adenocarcinoma 
A multi-centre, open-label, randomised study, was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
docetaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including 
adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who had not received prior chemotherapy for 
metastatic disease. A total of 445 patients with KPS > 70 were treated with either docetaxel (T)

(75 mg/m2 on day 1) in combination with cisplatin (C) (75 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (F) 
(750 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) or cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 per 
day for 5 days). The length of a treatment cycle was 3 weeks for the TCF arm and 4 weeks for the CF 
arm. The median number of cycles administered per patient was 6 (with a range of 1-16) for the TCF 
arm compared to 4 (with a range of 1-12) for the CF arm. Time to progression (TTP) was the primary 
endpoint. The risk reduction of progression was 32.1% and was associated with a significantly longer 
TTP (p = 0.0004) in favour of the TCF arm. Overall survival was also significantly longer 
(p = 0.0201) in favour of the TCF arm with a risk reduction of mortality of 22.7%. Efficacy results are

Subgroup analyses across age, gender and race consistently favoured the TCF arm compared to the CF 
arm.  
A survival update analysis conducted with a median follow-up time of 41.6 months no longer showed 
a statistically significant difference although always in favour of the TCF regimen and showed that the 
benefit of TCF over CF is clearly observed between 18 and 30 months of follow up.  
Overall, quality of life (QoL) and clinical benefit results consistently indicated improvement in favour 
of the TCF arm. Patients treated with TCF had a longer time to 5% definitive deterioration of global 
health status on the QLQ-C30 questionnaire (p = 0.0121) and a longer time to definitive worsening of 
Karnofsky performance status (p = 0.0088) compared to patients treated with CF. 
Head and neck cancer 
Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX323)  
• 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a phase III, multi-centre, open-label, 
randomised study (TAX323). In this study, 358 patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN, 
and WHO performance status 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two treatment arms. Patients on the 
docetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin (P) 75 mg/m2 followed by 
5-fluorouracil (F) 750 mg/m2 per day as a continuous infusion for 5 days. This regimen was 
administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at least a minor response (≥ 25% reduction in 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with 
a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not 
progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (TPF/RT). 
Patients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m2 followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) 
1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days. This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case 
at least a minor response (≥ 25% reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed 
after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval 
of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to 
institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (PF/RT). Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either 
with a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy - 2.0 Gy once a day, 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to 
70 Gy), or accelerated/hyperfractionated regimens of radiation therapy (twice a day, with a minimum 
interfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week). A total of 70 Gy was recommended for accelerated 
regimens and 74 Gy for hyperfractionated schemes. Surgical resection was allowed following 
chemotherapy, before or after radiotherapy. Patients on the TPF arm received antibiotic prophylaxis 
with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. 
The primary endpoint in this study, progression-free survival (PFS), was significantly longer in the 
TPF arm compared to the PF arm, p = 0.0042 (median PFS: 11.4 vs. 8.3 months respectively) with an 
overall median follow up time of 33.7 months. Median overall survival was also significantly longer in 
favour of the TPF arm compared to the PF arm (median OS: 18.6 vs. 14.5 months respectively) with a 
28% risk reduction of mortality, p = 0.0128. Efficacy results are presented in the table below:

Quality of life parameters 
Patients treated with TPF experienced significantly less deterioration of their Global health score 
compared to those treated with PF (p = 0.01, using the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale). 
Clinical benefit parameters 
The performance status scale, for head and neck (PSS-HN) subscales designed to measure 
understandability of speech, ability to eat in public, and normalcy of diet, was significantly in favour 
of TPF as compared to PF. 
Median time to first deterioration of WHO performance status was significantly longer in the TPF arm 
compared to PF. Pain intensity score improved during treatment in both groups indicating adequate 
pain management.  
Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX324)  
• 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a randomised, multi-centre 
open-label, phase III, study (TAX324). In this study, 501 patients, with locally advanced SCCHN, and 
a WHO performance status of 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two arms. The study population 
comprised patients with technically unresectable disease, patients with low probability of surgical cure 
and patients aiming at organ preservation. The efficacy and safety evaluation solely addressed survival 
endpoints and the success of organ preservation was not formally addressed. Patients on the docetaxel 
arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m² by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) 
100 mg/m² administered as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the continuous 
intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m²/day from day 1 to day 4. The cycles were 
repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to receive 
chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per protocol (TPF/CRT). Patients on the comparator arm received 
cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m² as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by the 
continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m²/day from day 1 to day 5. The cycles 
were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to 
receive CRT as per protocol (PF/CRT).  
Patients in both treatment arms were to receive 7 weeks of CRT following induction chemotherapy 
with a minimum interval of 3 weeks and no later than 8 weeks after start of the last cycle (day 22 to 
day 56 of last cycle). During radiotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 1.5) was given weekly as a one-hour 
intravenous infusion for a maximum of 7 doses. Radiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment 
using once daily fractionation (2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks, for a total dose of 
70-72 Gy). Surgery on the primary site of disease and/or neck could be considered at anytime 
following completion of CRT. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the study received 
prophylactic antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study, overall survival (OS) was 
significantly longer (log-rank test, p = 0.0058) with the docetaxel-containing regimen compared to PF 
(median OS: 70.6 versus 30.1 months respectively), with a 30% risk reduction in mortality compared 
to PF (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.90) with an overall median 
follow up time of 41.9 months. The secondary endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a 29% risk reduction of 
progression or death and a 22 month improvement in median PFS (35.5 months for TPF and 13.1 for 
PF). This was also statistically significant with an HR of 0.71; 95% CI 0.56-0.90; log-rank test 
p = 0.004. Efficacy results are presented in the table below:

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel have been evaluated in cancer patients after administration of 20-
115 mg/m2 in phase I studies. The kinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent with 
a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model with half-lives for the α, β and γ (terminal) phases of 
4 min, 36 min and between 11.1 h and 17.5 h, respectively, when sampled up to 24 hours. An 
additional study assessing the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel at similar doses (75 – 100 mg/m2) in 
patients, but over a longer time interval (over 22 days) found a longer mean terminal elimination 
halflife between 91 and 120 hours. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of 
docetaxel from the peripheral compartment. 
Distribution 
Following the administration of a 100 mg/m2 dose given as a one-hour infusion a mean peak plasma 
level of 3.7 μg/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.6 h.μg/ml. Mean values for total body 
clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter 
individual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% 
bound to plasma proteins.  
Elimination 
A study of 14C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in 
both the urine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl 
ester group, within seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is 
excreted during the first 48 hours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites 
and very low amounts of unchanged medicinal product. 
Special populations 
Age and gender 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from phase I 
studies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient. 
Hepatic impairment 
In a small number of patients (n = 23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver 
function impairment (ALT, AST ≥ 1.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase ≥ 2.5 
times the ULN), total clearance was lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2). 
Fluid retention 
Docetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to moderate fluid retention and there are 
no data available in patients with severe fluid retention. 
Combination therapy 
Doxorubicin 
When used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma 
levels of doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin 
and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their co-administration.  
Capecitabine 
Phase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice versa 
showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no 
effect by docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5'-DFUR.  
Cisplatin 
Clearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed following 
monotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel infusion is 
similar to that observed with cisplatin alone.  
Cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil 
The combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid 
tumours had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product.  
Prednisone and dexamethasone 
The effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard 
dexamethasone premedication has been studied in 42 patients. 
Prednisone 
No effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. 
5.3   Preclinical safety data 
The carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. 
Docetaxel has been shown to be genotoxic by an aneugenic mechanism  in the in vitro micronucleus 
and chromosome aberration test in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. 
However, it did not induce mutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. 
These results are consistent with the pharmacological activity of docetaxel.  
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Undesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair 
male fertility.

DOCETAXEL KABI is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, 
caution should be exercised when handling it and preparing the solution. The use of gloves is 
recommended. 
If DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, wash 
immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate or infusion 
solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately and thoroughly with 
water. 
Preparation for the intravenous administration 
Preparation of the infusion solution 
DO NOT use other docetaxel medicinal products consisting of 2 vials (concentrate and solvent) 
with this medicinal product (DOCETAXEL KABI 20 mg/1 ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion, which contains only 1 vial). 
DOCETAXEL KABI 20 mg/1 ml concentrate for solution for infusion requires NO prior 
dilution with a solvent and is ready to add to the infusion solution. 
Each vial is for single use and should be used immediately. 
If the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required number of boxes of DOCETAXEL KABI 
concentrate for solution for infusion to stand below 25°C for 5 minutes before use. More than one vial 
of DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate for solution for infusion may be necessary to obtain the required 
dose for the patient. Aseptically withdraw the required amount of DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate 
for solution for infusion using a calibrated syringe.  
In DOCETAXEL KABI 20 mg/1 ml vial the concentration of docetaxel is 20 mg/ml. 
The  required  volume  of  DOCETAXEL  KABI  concentrate  for  solution  for infusion  must be  injected 
via  a  single  injection  (one  shot)  into  a  250 ml  infusion  bag  or  bottle  containing  either  5%  glucose 
solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. 
If a dose greater than 190 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so 
that a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. 
Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. 
The infusion bag solution should be used within 6 hours below 25°C including the one hour infusion 
to the patient. 
As with all parenteral products, DOCETAXEL KABI infusion solution should be visually inspected 
prior to use, and solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. 
Docetaxel infusion solution is supersaturated, therefore may crystallize over time. If crystals appear, 
the solution must no longer be used and shall be discarded. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

treatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The use of docetaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy and it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the 
use of anticancer chemotherapy (see section 6.6). 
Posology 
For breast, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers, premedication consisting of an oral 
corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to 
docetaxel administration, unless contraindicated, can be used (see section 4.4).  
For metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone or 
prednisolone the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours 
and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). 
For metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, irrespective of the concurrent use of prednisone or 
prednisolone, the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg 12 hours, 3 hours, 
and 1 hour before docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). 
Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. 
Docetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks.  
Breast cancer 
In the adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive and node-negative breast cancer, the recommended 
dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 
500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (TAC regimen) (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). 
For the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose 
of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 in monotherapy. In first-line treatment, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 is given in 
combination therapy with doxorubicin (50 mg/m2). 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In combination with trastuzumab the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 every three weeks, 
with trastuzumab administered weekly. In the pivotal study the initial docetaxel infusion was started 
the day following the first dose of trastuzumab. The subsequent docetaxel doses were administered 
immediately after completion of the trastuzumab infusion, if the preceding dose of trastuzumab was 
well tolerated. For trastuzumab dose and administration, see trastuzumab summary of product 
characteristics.  
In combination with capecitabine, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every three weeks, 
combined with capecitabine at 1250 mg/m2 twice daily (within 30 minutes after a meal) for 2 weeks 
followed by a 1-week rest period. For capecitabine dose calculation according to body surface area, 
see capecitabine summary of product characteristics.  
Non-small cell lung cancer 
In chemotherapy naïve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen 
is docetaxel 75 mg/m2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment 
after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m² as a single 
agent. 
Prostate cancer 
Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer  
The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2. Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily 
is administered continuously (see section 5.1). 
Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Prednisone or 
prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily may be administered continuously. 
Gastric adenocarcinoma 
The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion, followed by cisplatin 
75 mg/m2, as a 1- to 3- hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m2 per 
day given as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion. 
Treatment is repeated every three weeks. Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and 
appropriate hydration for cisplatin administration. Prophylactic G-CSF should be used to mitigate the 
risk of haematological toxicities (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). 
Head and neck cancer 
Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and appropriate hydration (prior to and after 
cisplatin administration). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological 
toxicities. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the TAX 323 and TAX 324 studies, received 
prophylactic antibiotics. 
• 
• 
Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX 323) 
For the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head 
and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion 
followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a 
continuous infusion at 750 mg/m2 per day for five days. This regimen is administered every 
3 weeks for 4 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should receive radiotherapy. 
Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX 324) 
For the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low 
probability of surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour 
intravenous infusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered as a 30-minute to 
3-hour infusion, followed by 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion from day 1 
to day 4. This regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. Following chemotherapy, 
patients should receive chemoradiotherapy.

Dose adjustments during treatment 
General 
Docetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3. 
In patients who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3 for more than 
one week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel 
therapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 and/or from 75 to 
60 mg/m². If the patient continues to experience these reactions at 60 mg/m², the treatment should be 
discontinued. 
Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer 
Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive docetaxel, doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide (TAC) adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Patients who experience febrile 
neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection should have their docetaxel dose reduced to 60 mg/m² in all 
subsequent cycles (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis should 
have their dose decreased to 60 mg/m². 
In combination with cisplatin 
For patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose 
nadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is < 25,000 cells/mm3, or in patients who 
experience febrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-haematologic toxicities, the docetaxel 
dose in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg/m2. For cisplatin dose adjustments, see the 
corresponding summary of product characteristics.  
In combination with capecitabine 
•  For capecitabine dose modifications, see capecitabine summary of product characteristics. 
•  For patients developing the first appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, which persists at the time of the 
next docetaxel/capecitabine treatment, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, and resume at 
100% of the original dose. 
•  For patients developing the second appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, or the first appearance of 
Grade 3 toxicity, at any time during the treatment cycle, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 
0-1 and then resume treatment with docetaxel 55 mg/m². 
•  For any subsequent appearances of toxicities, or any Grade 4 toxicities, discontinue the docetaxel 
dose. 
For trastuzumab dose modifications, see trastuzumab summary of product characteristics. 
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil 
If an episode of febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection occurs despite 
G-CSF use, the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. If subsequent episodes of 
complicated neutropenia occur the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 60 to 45 mg/m2. In case of 
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. Patients should 
not be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until neutrophils recover to a level 
>1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level >100,000 cells/mm3. Discontinue treatment if these 
toxicities persist (see section 4.4). 
Recommended dose modifications for toxicities in patients treated with docetaxel in combination with 
cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): 
Toxicity

Second episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles. 
Third episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%. 
Stomatitis/mucositis grade 4 
First episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles. 
Second episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%. 
For cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose adjustments, see the corresponding summary of product 
characteristics. 
In the pivotal SCCHN studies patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged 
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide 
prophylactic coverage (eg, day 6-15) in all subsequent cycles. 
Special populations 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Based on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/m² as single agent, patients who have both 
elevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal 
range (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of 
docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin > ULN and/or 
ALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase > 6 times the ULN, no 
dose-reduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. 
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric 
adenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 × ULN 
associated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 × ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no 
dose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No 
data are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other 
indications.  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of DOCETAXEL KABI in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged 
1 month to less than 18 years have not yet been established. 
There is no relevant use of DOCETAXEL KABI in the paediatric population in the indications breast 
cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma and head and neck cancer, not 
including type II and III less differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 
Elderly  
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in the elderly. 
In combination with capecitabine, for patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of 
capecitabine to 75% is recommended (see capecitabine summary of product characteristics). 
Method of administration 
For instructions on preparation and administration of the product, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Patients with baseline neutrophil count of < 1,500 cells/mm3. 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with severe liver impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Contraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
For breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as 
dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel 
administration, unless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well 
as the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral 
dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2). 
Haematology 
Neutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median 
of 7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of 
complete blood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be 
retreated with docetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). 
In the case of severe neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of 
docetaxel therapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate 
symptomatic measures are recommended (see section 4.2). 
In patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile 
neutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic 
G-CSF. Patients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of 
complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). 
Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
In patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), 
febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received 
primary G-CSF prophylaxis. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive 
adjuvant therapy with TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile 
neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TAC should be 
closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Gastrointestinal reactions 
Caution is recommended for patients with neutropenia, particularly at risk for developing 
gastrointestinal complications. Although majority of cases occurred during the first or second cycle of 
docetaxel containing regimen, enterocolitis could develop at any time, and could lead to death as early 
as on the first day of onset. Patients should be closely monitored for early manifestations of serious 
gastrointestinal toxicity (see sections 4.2, 4.4 Haematology, and 4.8). 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and 
second infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation 
of the infusion of docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should 
be available. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised 
cutaneous reactions do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe 
hypotension, bronchospasm or generalised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of 
docetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions 
should not be re-challenged with docetaxel. Patients who have previously experienced a 
hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel may be at risk to develop hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel, 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
including more severe hypersensitivity reaction. These patients should be closely monitored during 
initiation of docetaxel therapy. 
Cutaneous reactions 
Localised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema 
followed by desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by 
desquamation which lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see 
section 4.2). 
Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic 
Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) have been 
reported with docetaxel treatment. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of 
serious skin manifestations and closely monitored. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions 
appear discontinuation of docetaxel should be considered. 
Fluid retention 
Patients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be 
monitored closely. 
Respiratory disorders 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, 
pulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure have been reported and may be associated with fatal 
outcome. Cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant 
radiotherapy. 
If new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop, patients should be closely monitored, promptly 
investigated, and appropriately treated. Interruption of docetaxel therapy is recommended until 
diagnosis is available. Early use of supportive care measures may help improve the condition. The 
benefit of resuming docetaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated. 
Patients with liver impairment 
In patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels 
(ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels 
greater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as 
toxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, 
infections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel 
in those patients with elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m2 and LFTs should be measured at 
baseline and before each cycle (see section 4.2). 
For patients with serum bilirubin levels > ULN and/or ALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN concurrent 
with serum alkaline phosphatase levels > 6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended 
and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. 
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric 
adenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 × ULN 
associated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 × ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no 
dose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No 
data are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other 
indications.  
Patients with renal impairment 
There are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel. 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nervous system 
The development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2). 
Cardiac toxicity 
Heart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, 
particularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may 
be moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8). 
When patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they 
should undergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during 
treatment (e.g. every three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For 
more details see summary of product characteristics of trastuzumab.  
Ventricular arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia (sometimes fatal) has been reported in 
patients treated with docetaxel in combination regimens including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and/ or 
cyclophosphamide (see section 4.8).  
Baseline cardiac assessment is recommended.   
Eye disorders 
Cystoid macular oedema (CMO) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with 
impaired vision should undergo a prompt and complete ophthalmologic examination. In case CMO is 
diagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated (see section 
4.8). 
Second primary malignancies 
Second primary malignancies have been reported when docetaxel was given in combination with 
anticancer treatments known to be associated with second primary malignancies.  Second primary 
malignancies (including acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma) may occur several months or years after docetaxel-containing therapy. Patients should be 
monitored for second primary malignancies (see section 4.8). 
Tumour Lysis Syndrome 
Tumour lysis syndrome has been reported with docetaxel after the first or the second cycle (see section 
4.8). Patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome (e.g. with renal impairment, hyperuricemia, bulky 
tumour, rapid progression) should be closely monitored. Correction of dehydration and treatment of 
high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of treatment. 
Others 
Women of childbearing potential must use contraceptive measures during treatment and for 2 months 
after cessation of treatment with docetaxel. Men must use contraceptive measures during treatment 
and for 4 months after cessation of treatment with docetaxel (see section 4.6). 
The concomitant use of docetaxel with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and 
voriconazole) should be avoided (see section 4.5). 
Additional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer 
Complicated neutropenia 
For patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or 
infection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). 
Gastrointestinal reactions 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Symptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, 
may be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated 
promptly. 
Congestive heart failure (CHF) 
Patients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the 
follow up period. In patients treated with the TAC regimen for node positive breast cancer, the risk of 
CHF has been shown to be higher during the first year after treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Patients with 4+ nodes 
As the benefit observed in patient with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on disease-free 
survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with 4+ 
nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis (see section 5.1). 
Elderly  
Cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer 
There are limited data available in patients > 70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with 
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. 
Cautions for use in castration-resistant prostate cancer 
Of the 333 patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks in a prostate cancer study (TAX 327), 
209 patients were 65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients 
treated with docetaxel every three weeks, the incidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate 
≥ 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients. The 
incidence of related fever, diarrhoea, anorexia, and peripheral oedema occurred at rates ≥ 10% higher 
in patients who were 75 years of age or greater versus less than 65 years. 
Cautions for use in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
Of the 545 patients treated with docetaxel every 3 weeks in a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer study 
(STAMPEDE), 296 patients were 65 years of age or older, and 48 patients were 75 years of age or 
older. More patients aged ≥65 years in the docetaxel arm reported hypersensitivity reaction, 
neutropenia, anaemia, fluid retention, dyspnea, and nail changes when compared to the patients aged 
less than 65 years. None of these increases in frequency reached 10% difference with the control arm. 
In patients who were 75 years of age or older, when compared to younger patients, neutropenia, 
anaemia, diarrhea, dyspnea and upper respiratory tract infection were reported with a greater incidence 
(at least 10% higher).  
Cautions for use in gastric adenocarcinoma cancer 
Among the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) 
patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer 
study, 74 were 65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of 
serious adverse events was higher in older people compared to younger patients. The incidence of the 
following adverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection occurred at rates 
≥ 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients. 
Elderly people treated with TCF should be closely monitored. 
Excipients 
This medicine contains 1.58 g of alcohol (ethanol) in each 4 ml which is equivalent to 39.5% w/v. The 
amount in 9 ml of dose is equivalent to 88.9 ml of beer and 35.6 ml of wine. 
Harmful for those suffering from alcoholism. 
To be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women, children and high-risk groups 
such as patients with liver disease, or epilepsy. 
Because this medicine is usually given slowly over 1 hours, the effects of alcohol may be reduced.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may alter the effects of other medicinal products. 
Co-administration with medicines containing e.g.propylene glycol or ethanol may lead to 
accumulation of ethanol and induce adverse effects, in particular in young children with low or 
immature metabolic capacity. 
In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant 
administration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the 
enzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as ciclosporine, ketoconazole and erythromycin. As 
a result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with these medicinal products as 
concomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction. 
In case of combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors, the occurrence of docetaxel adverse reactions may 
increase, as a result of reduced metabolism. If the concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin and voriconazole) cannot be avoided, a close clinical surveillance is warranted and a 
dose-adjustment of docetaxel may be suitable during the treatment with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor 
(see section 4.4). In a pharmacokinetic study with 7 patients, the co-administration of docetaxel with 
the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole leads to a significant decrease in docetaxel clearance by 
49%. 
Docetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic 
prostate cancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4. 
No statistically significant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. 
Docetaxel is highly protein bound (> 95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with 
concomitantly administered medicinal product has not been investigated formally, in vitro interactions 
with tightly protein-bound agents such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, propafenone, 
phenytoin, salicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein binding of 
docetaxel. In addition, dexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. Docetaxel did not 
influence the binding of digitoxin. 
The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their 
co-administration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction 
between docetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was 
about 50% higher than values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/ Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential and men receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming 
pregnant, and not to father a child and to inform the treating physician immediately should this occur.  
Due to the genotoxic risk of docetaxel (see section 5.3) women of childbearing potential must use 
effective method of contraception during treatment and for 2 months after cessation of treatment with 
docetaxel. Men must use effective method of contraception during treatment and for 4 months after 
cessation of treatment with docetaxel. 
Pregnancy 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be 
both embryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats. As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, 
docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Therefore, docetaxel must 
not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated.  
Breast-feeding 
Docetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. 
Consequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be 
discontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy. 
Fertility 
Studies in animals have shown that docetaxel may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). Therefore, 
males being treated with docetaxel must seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. The amount of 
alcohol in this medicinal product and the side effects of the product may impair the ability to drive or 
use machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Therefore, patients should be warned of the potential impact 
of the amount of alcohol and the side effects of this medicinal product on the ability to drive or use 
machines, and be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience these side effects during 
treatment. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile for all indications 
The adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel 
have been obtained in: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
1,312 and 121 patients who received 100 mg/m² and 75 mg/m² of docetaxel as a single agent 
respectively. 
258 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin. 
406 patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin. 
92 patients treated with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab. 
255 patients who received docetaxel in combination with capecitabine. 
332 patients (TAX327) who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 
(clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). 
1,276 patients (744 and 532 in TAX 316 and GEICAM 9805 respectively) who received 
docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (clinically important 
treatment related adverse events are presented). 
300 gastric adenocarcinoma patients (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 
79 patients in the phase II part) who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 
5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). 
174 and 251 head and neck cancer patients who received docetaxel in combination with 
cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). 
545 patients (STAMPEDE study) who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or 
prednisolone and ADT. 
These reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; 
grade 3-4 = G3/4; grade 4 = G4), the COSTART and the MedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined as: 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available 
data). 
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was 
reversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe 
neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea 
and asthenia. The severity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in 
combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. 
For combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in ≥ 10% are displayed. There 
was an increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the 
trastuzumab combination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. 
For combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects (≥ 5%) 
reported in a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see 
capecitabine summary of product characteristics). 
For combination with ADT and with prednisone or prednisolone (STAMPEDE study), adverse events 
occurring over the 6 cycles of treatment with docetaxel and having at least 2% higher incidence in the 
docetaxel treatment arm by comparison to the control arm, are presented, using the CTCAE grading 
scale. 
The following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel:  
Immune system disorders 
Hypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the 
infusion of docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms 
were flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills. 
Severe reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized 
rash/erythema (see section 4.4). 
Nervous system disorders 
The development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4). Mild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paraesthesia, dysesthesia or pain 
including burning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Reversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to 
moderate. Reactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and 
hands (including severe hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently 
associated with pruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. 
Less frequently, severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to 
interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe 
nail disorders are characterised by hypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyper pigmentation, inflammation, 
redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis or extravasation and swelling of the vein.  
Fluid retention includes events such as peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, 
pericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain. The peripheral oedema usually starts at the lower 
extremities and may become generalised with a weight gain of 3 kg or more. Fluid retention is 
cumulative in incidence and severity (see section 4.4).

Description of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for DOCETAXEL KABI 100 mg/m² single 
agent 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Rare: bleeding episodes associated with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia.  
Nervous system disorders 
Reversibility data are available among 35.3% of patients who developed neurotoxicity following 
docetaxel treatment at 100 mg/m² as single agent. The events were spontaneously reversible within 
3 months. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Very rare: one case of alopecia non-reversible at the end of the study. 73% of the cutaneous reactions 
were reversible within 21 days. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation was more than 1,000 mg/m2 and the median 
time to fluid retention reversibility was 16.4 weeks (range 0 to 42 weeks). The onset of moderate and 
severe retention is delayed (median cumulative dose: 818.9 mg/m2) in patients with premedication 
compared with patients without premedication (median cumulative dose: 489.7 mg/m2); however, it 
has been reported in some patients during the early courses of therapy.

Description of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for DOCETAXEL KABI 100 mg/m² in 
combination with trastuzumab 
Cardiac disorders 
Symptomatic cardiac failure was reported in 2.2% of the patients who received docetaxel plus 
trastuzumab compared to 0% of patients given docetaxel alone. In the docetaxel plus trastuzumab arm, 
64% had received a prior anthracycline as adjuvant therapy compared with 55% in the docetaxel arm 
alone. 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Very common: Haematological toxicity was increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and 
docetaxel, compared with docetaxel alone (32% grade 3/4 neutropenia versus 22%, using NCI-CTC 
criteria). Note that this is likely to be an underestimate since docetaxel alone at a dose of 100 mg/m2 is 
known to result in neutropenia in 97% of patients, 76% grade 4, based on nadir blood counts. The 
incidence of febrile neutropenia/neutropenic sepsis was also increased in patients treated with 
Herceptin plus docetaxel (23% versus 17% for patients treated with docetaxel alone).

Post-marketing experience 
Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) 
Second primary malignancies (frequency not known), including non-Hodgkin lymphoma have been 
reported in association with docetaxel when used in combination with other anticancer treatments 
known to be associated with second primary malignancies. Acute myeloid leukemia and 
myelodysplastic syndrome have been reported (frequency uncommon) in pivotal clinical studies in 
breast cancer with TAC regimen. 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Bone marrow suppression and other haematologic adverse reactions have been reported. Disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multi-organ failure, has been 
reported. 
Immune system disorders 
Some cases of anaphylactic shock, sometimes fatal, have been reported. 
Hypersensitivity reactions (frequency not known) have been reported with docetaxel in patients who 
previously experienced hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel. 
Nervous system disorders 
Rare cases of convulsion or transient loss of consciousness have been observed with docetaxel 
administration. These reactions sometimes appear during the infusion of the medicinal product. 
Eye disorders 
Very rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring 
during infusion of the medicinal product and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been 
reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of lacrimation with or 
without conjunctivitis, as cases of lacrimal duct obstruction resulting in excessive tearing have been 
rarely reported. Cases of cystoid macular oedema (CMO) have been reported in patients treated with 
docetaxel.

cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Rare cases of enterocolitis, including colitis, ischemic colitis, and neutropenic enterocolitis, have been 
reported with a potential fatal outcome (frequency not known). 
Rare occurrences of dehydration have been reported as a consequence of gastrointestinal events 
including enterocolitis and gastrointestinal perforation.  
Rare cases of ileus and intestinal obstruction have been reported. 
Hepatobiliary disorders 
Very rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, 
have been reported. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus, bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme and severe 
cutaneous adverse reactions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis 
(TEN) and Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with docetaxel.  
Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphoedema have been reported with 
docetaxel. Cases of permanent alopecia (frequency not known) have been reported. 
Renal and urinary disorders 
Renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported. In about 20% of these cases there were no 
risk factors for acute renal failure such as concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products and 
gastrointestinal disorders. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Radiation recall phenomena have rarely been reported. 
Injection site recall reaction (recurrence of skin reaction at a site of previous extravasation following 
administration of docetaxel at a different site) has been observed at the site of previous extravasation 
(frequency not known). 
Fluid retention has not been accompanied by acute episodes of oliguria or hypotension. Dehydration 
and pulmonary oedema have rarely been reported. 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
Cases of electrolyte imbalance have been reported. Cases of hyponatraemia have been reported, 
mostly associated with dehydration, vomiting and pneumonia. Hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and 
hypocalcaemia were observed, usually in association with gastrointestinal disorders and in particular 
with diarrhoea. Tumour lysis syndrome, potentially fatal, has been reported (frequency not known). 
Musculoskeletal disorder 
Myositis has been reported with docetaxel (frequency not known).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9 
Overdose 
There were a few reports of overdose. There is no known antidote for docetaxel overdose. In case of 
overdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and vital functions closely monitored. In 
cases of overdose, exacerbation of adverse events may be expected. The primary anticipated 
complications of overdose would consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity and 
mucositis. Patients should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose. 
Other appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken, as needed.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, plant alkaloids and other natural products, taxanes, 
ATC Code: L01CD02  
Mechanism of action 
Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable 
microtubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The 
binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. 
Docetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for 
vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and 
against freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular 
concentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some 
but not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance 
gene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental anti-tumour 
activity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Breast cancer 
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide: adjuvant therapy 
Patients with operable node-positive breast cancer (TAX 316) 
Data from a multi-centre open-label randomised study support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant 
treatment of patients with operable node-positive breast cancer and KPS ≥ 80%, between 18 and 
70 years of age. After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 
4+), 1491 patients were randomised to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after 
doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 
followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclosphosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FAC arm). Both regimens 
were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, 
76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
all other medicinal products were given as intravenous bolus on day one. G-CSF was administered as 
secondary prophylaxis to patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, 
prolonged neutropenia, or infection). Patients on the TAC arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with 
ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. In 
both arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with positive oestrogen and/or progesterone 
receptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed 
according to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 69% of patients who 
received TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC. Two interim analyses and one final analysis 
were performed. The first interim analysis was planned 3 years after the date when half of study 
enrolment was done. The second interim analysis was done after 400 DFS events had been recorded 
overall, which led to a median follow-up of 55 months. The final analysis was performed when all 
patients had reached their 10-year follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow 
up before). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) 
was the secondary efficacy endpoint. 
A final analysis was performed with an actual median follow up of 96 months. Significantly longer 
disease-free survival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. Incidence of 
relapses at 10 years was reduced in patients receiving TAC compared to those who received FAC 
(39% versus 45%, respectively) i.e. an absolute risk reduction by 6% (p = 0.0043). Overall survival at 
10 years was also significantly increased with TAC compared to FAC (76% versus 69%, respectively) 
i.e. an absolute reduction of the risk of death by 7% (p = 0.002). As the benefit observed in patients 
with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on DFS and OS, the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC 
in patients with 4+ nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis. 
Overall, the study results demonstrate a positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC.

Patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy (GEICAM 9805) 
Data from a multi-centre open-label randomised trial support the use of DOCETAXEL KABI for the 
adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive 
chemotherapy. 1060 patients were randomised to receive either DOCETAXEL KABI 75 mg/m2 
administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (539 patients in 
TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclosphosphamide 
500 mg/m2 (521 patients in FAC arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable node-negative breast cancer 
patients with high risk of relapse according to 1998 St. Gallen criteria (tumour size > 2 cm and/or 
negative ER and PR and/or high histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and /or age < 35 years).). 
Both regimens were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. DOCETAXEL KABI was 
administered as a 1-hour infusion, all other medicinal products were given intraveinously on day 1 
every three weeks. Primary prophylactic G-CSF was made mandatory in TAC arm after 230 patients 
were randomised. The incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection

was decreased in patients who received primary G-CSF prophylaxis (see section 4.8). In both arms, 
after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ tumours received tamoxifen 
20 mg once a day for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was administered according to 
guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 57.3% of patients who received TAC 
and 51.2% of patients who received FAC. 
One primary analysis and one updated analysis were performed. The primary analysis was done when 
all patients had a follow-up of greater than 5 years (median follow-up time of 77 months). The updated 
analysis was performed when all patients had reached their 10-year (median follow up time of 10 
years and 5 months) follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow-up 
previously). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) 
was the secondary efficacy endpoint. 
At the median follow-up time of 77 months, significantly longer disease-free survival for the TAC arm 
compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in the risk of 
relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), p = 0.01). At the 
median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 16,5% reduction in the 
risk of relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% CI (0.65-1.08), 
p=0.1646). DFS data were not statistically significant but were still associated with a positive trend in 
favour of TAC.   
At the median follow-up time of 77 months overall survival (OS) was longer in the TAC arm with 
TAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk of death compared to FAC (hazard ratio = 
0.76, 95% CI (0.46-1.26, p = 0.29). However, the distribution of OS was not significantly different 
between the 2 groups. 
At the median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 9% reduction in 
the risk of death compared to FAC-treated patients (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% CI (0.63-1.32)).  
The survival rate was 93.7% in the TAC arm and 91.4 % in the FAC arm, at the 8-year follow-up time 
point, and 91.3 % in the TAC arm and 89 % in the FAC arm, at the 10-year follow-up time point. 
The positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC remained unchanged.   
TAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were analysed 
in the primary analysis (at the median follow-up time of 77 months) (see table below):

DOCETAXEL KABI as single agent 
Two randomised phase III comparative studies, involving a total of 326 alkylating or 
392 anthracycline failure metastatic breast cancer patients, have been performed with docetaxel at the 
recommended dose and regimen of 100 mg/m² every 3 weeks. 
In alkylating-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to doxorubicin (75 mg/m² every 3 weeks). 
Without affecting overall survival time (docetaxel 15 months vs. doxorubicin 14 months, p = 0.38) or 
time to progression (docetaxel 27 weeks vs. doxorubicin 23 weeks, p = 0.54), docetaxel increased 
response rate (52% vs. 37%, p = 0.01) and shortened time to response (12 weeks vs. 23 weeks, 
p= 0.007). Three docetaxel patients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas 
15 doxorubicin patients (9%) discontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart 
failure). 
In anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and 
vinblastine (12 mg/m² every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m² every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate 
(33% vs. 12%, p < 0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p= 0.0004) and 
prolonged overall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p= 0.01). 
During these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety profile 
observed in phase II studies (see section 4.8).

An open-label, multi-centre, randomised phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel 
monotherapy and paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous 
therapy should have included an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomised to receive 
either docetaxel monotherapy 100 mg/m² as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m² as a 3 hour 
infusion. Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks. 
Without affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p = 0.10), docetaxel 
prolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p < 0.01) and median survival 
(15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p = 0.03). 
More grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to 
paclitaxel (23.0%). 
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with doxorubicin 
One large randomised phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic 
disease, has been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/m²) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m²) 
(AT arm) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/m²) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m²) (AC 
arm). Both regimens were administered on day 1 every 3 weeks.  
•  Time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.0138. 
The median TTP was 37.3 weeks (95% CI: 33.4 - 42.1) in AT arm and 31.9 weeks (95% CI: 27.4 - 
36.0) in AC arm.  
•  Overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.009. 
The ORR was 59.3% (95% CI: 52.8 - 65.9) in AT arm versus 46.5% (95% CI: 39.8 - 53.2) in AC 
arm.  
In this study, AT arm showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile 
neutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), infection (8% versus 2.4%), diarrhoea (7.5% versus 1.4%), asthenia 
(8.5% versus 2.4%), and pain (2.8% versus 0%) than AC arm. On the other hand, AC arm showed a 
higher incidence of severe anaemia (15.8% versus 8.5%) than AT arm, and, in addition, a higher 
incidence of severe cardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF 
decrease ≥ 20% (13.1% versus 6.1%), absolute LVEF decrease ≥ 30% (6.2% versus 1.1%). Toxic 
deaths occurred in 1 patient in the AT arm (congestive heart failure) and in 4 patients in the AC arm 
(1 due to septic shock and 3 due to congestive heart failure).  
In both arms, quality of life measured by the EORTC questionnaire was comparable and stable during 
treatment and follow-up.  
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with trastuzumab 
Docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab was studied for the treatment of patients with metastatic 
breast cancer whose tumours overexpress HER2, and who previously had not received chemotherapy 
for metastatic disease. One hundred eighty six patients were randomised to receive docetaxel 
(100 mg/m2) with or without trastuzumab; 60% of patients received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant 
chemotherapy. Docetaxel plus trastuzumab was efficacious in patients whether or not they had 
received prior adjuvant anthracyclines. The main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in 
this pivotal study was immunohistochemistry (IHC). A minority of patients were tested using 
fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). In this study, 87% of patients had disease that was IHC 3+, 
and 95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC 3+ and/or FISH positive. Efficacy results are 
summarized in the following table:

DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with capecitabine 
Data from one multi-centre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical study support the use of 
docetaxel in combination with capecitabine for treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy, including an anthracycline. In this 
study, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous 
infusion every 3 weeks) and capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week 
rest period). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/m2 as a 1 hour 
intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine 
combination arm (p = 0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 352 days 
(docetaxel alone). The overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator 
assessment) were 41.6% (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to 
progressive disease was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine combination arm (p < 0.0001). The 
median time to progression was 186 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
Patients previously treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy 
In a phase III study, in previously treated patients, time to progression (12.3 weeks versus 7 weeks) 
and overall survival were significantly longer for docetaxel at 75 mg/m² compared to Best Supportive 
Care. The 1-year survival rate was also significantly longer in docetaxel (40%) versus BSC (16%). 
There was less use of morphinic analgesic (p < 0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p < 0.01), other 
disease-related medicinal products (p = 0.06) and radiotherapy (p < 0.01) in patients treated with 
docetaxel at 75 mg/m² compared to those with BSC.  
The overall response rate was 6.8% in the evaluable patients, and the median duration of response was 
26.1 weeks.  
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with platinum agents in chemotherapy-naïve patients 
In a phase III study, 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or 
greater, and who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either 
docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/m2 over 
30-60 minutes every 3 weeks (TCis), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with 
carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/ml.min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/m2 
administered over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on 
day 1 of cycles repeated every 4 weeks (VCis).

Prostate cancer 
Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone in patients with 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were evaluated in a randomised multi-centre phase III 
study (TAX 327). A total of 1006 patients with KPS ≥ 60 were randomised to the following treatment 
groups:  
•  Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. 
•  Docetaxel 30 mg/m2 administered weekly for the first 5 weeks in a 6 week cycle for 5 cycles. 
•  Mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. 
All 3 regimens were administered in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily, 
continuously. 
Patients who received docetaxel every three weeks demonstrated significantly longer overall survival 
compared to those treated with mitoxantrone. The increase in survival seen in the docetaxel weekly 
arm was not statistically significant compared to the mitoxantrone control arm. Efficacy endpoints for 
the docetaxel arms versus the control arm are summarized in the following table:

Given the fact that docetaxel every week presented a slightly better safety profile than docetaxel every 
3 weeks, it is possible that certain patients may benefit from docetaxel every week.  
No statistical differences were observed between treatment groups for Global Quality of Life. 
Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
STAMPEDE study 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel administered concomitantly with standard of care (ADT) in 
patients with high-risk locally advanced or metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer were 
evaluated in a randomised multi-centre, multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) study with a seamless phase 
II/III design (STAMPEDE – MRC PR08). A total of 1776 male patients were allocated to the 
treatment arms of interest:  
•  Standard of care + docetaxel 75 mg/m², administered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles 
•  Standard of care alone  
Docetaxel regimen was administered in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily 
continuously.  
Among the 1776 randomised patients 1086 (61%) had metastatic disease, 362 were randomised to 
docetaxel in combination with standard of care, 724 received standard of care alone.  
In these metastatic prostate cancer patients, the median overall survival was significantly longer in 
docetaxel treatment groups than in the standard of care alone group, with a median overall survival 19 
months longer with the addition of docetaxel to standard of care (HR =  0.76, 95% CI = 0.62-0.92, 
p=0.005).  
Efficacy results in metastatic prostate cancer patients for docetaxel arm versus control arm are

CHAARTED study 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel administered at the beginning of androgen-deprivation therapy 
(ADT) in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer were evaluated in a randomised 
Phase III multi-centre study (CHAARTED). A total of 790 male patients were allocated to the 2 
treatment groups.  
•  ADT + docetaxel 75 mg/m² given at the beginning of ADT, administered every 3 weeks 
for 6 cycles 
•  ADT alone   
The median overall survival was significantly longer in docetaxel treatment group than in the ADT 
alone group, with a median overall survival 13.6 months longer with the addition of docetaxel to ADT

Gastric adenocarcinoma 
A multi-centre, open-label, randomised study, was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
docetaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including 
adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who had not received prior chemotherapy for 
metastatic disease. A total of 445 patients with KPS > 70 were treated with either docetaxel (T)

(75 mg/m2 on day 1) in combination with cisplatin (C) (75 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (F) 
(750 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) or cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 per 
day for 5 days). The length of a treatment cycle was 3 weeks for the TCF arm and 4 weeks for the CF 
arm. The median number of cycles administered per patient was 6 (with a range of 1-16) for the TCF 
arm compared to 4 (with a range of 1-12) for the CF arm. Time to progression (TTP) was the primary 
endpoint. The risk reduction of progression was 32.1% and was associated with a significantly longer 
TTP (p = 0.0004) in favour of the TCF arm. Overall survival was also significantly longer 
(p = 0.0201) in favour of the TCF arm with a risk reduction of mortality of 22.7%. Efficacy results are

Subgroup analyses across age, gender and race consistently favoured the TCF arm compared to the CF 
arm.  
A survival update analysis conducted with a median follow-up time of 41.6 months no longer showed 
a statistically significant difference although always in favour of the TCF regimen and showed that the 
benefit of TCF over CF is clearly observed between 18 and 30 months of follow up.  
Overall, quality of life (QoL) and clinical benefit results consistently indicated improvement in favour 
of the TCF arm. Patients treated with TCF had a longer time to 5% definitive deterioration of global 
health status on the QLQ-C30 questionnaire (p = 0.0121) and a longer time to definitive worsening of 
Karnofsky performance status (p = 0.0088) compared to patients treated with CF. 
Head and neck cancer 
Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX323)  
• 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a phase III, multi-centre, open-label, 
randomised study (TAX323). In this study, 358 patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN, 
and WHO performance status 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two treatment arms. Patients on the 
docetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin (P) 75 mg/m2 followed by 
5-fluorouracil (F) 750 mg/m2 per day as a continuous infusion for 5 days. This regimen was 
administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at least a minor response (≥ 25% reduction in 
86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with 
a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not 
progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (TPF/RT). 
Patients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m2 followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) 
1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days. This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case 
at least a minor response (≥ 25% reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed 
after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval 
of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to 
institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (PF/RT). Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either 
with a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy - 2.0 Gy once a day, 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to 
70 Gy), or accelerated/hyperfractionated regimens of radiation therapy (twice a day, with a minimum 
interfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week). A total of 70 Gy was recommended for accelerated 
regimens and 74 Gy for hyperfractionated schemes. Surgical resection was allowed following 
chemotherapy, before or after radiotherapy. Patients on the TPF arm received antibiotic prophylaxis 
with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. 
The primary endpoint in this study, progression-free survival (PFS), was significantly longer in the 
TPF arm compared to the PF arm, p = 0.0042 (median PFS: 11.4 vs. 8.3 months respectively) with an 
overall median follow up time of 33.7 months. Median overall survival was also significantly longer in 
favour of the TPF arm compared to the PF arm (median OS: 18.6 vs. 14.5 months respectively) with a 
28% risk reduction of mortality, p = 0.0128. Efficacy results are presented in the table below:

Quality of life parameters 
Patients treated with TPF experienced significantly less deterioration of their Global health score 
compared to those treated with PF (p = 0.01, using the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale). 
Clinical benefit parameters 
The performance status scale, for head and neck (PSS-HN) subscales designed to measure 
understandability of speech, ability to eat in public, and normalcy of diet, was significantly in favour 
of TPF as compared to PF. 
Median time to first deterioration of WHO performance status was significantly longer in the TPF arm 
compared to PF. Pain intensity score improved during treatment in both groups indicating adequate 
pain management.  
Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX324)  
• 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a randomised, multi-centre 
open-label, phase III, study (TAX324). In this study, 501 patients, with locally advanced SCCHN, and 
a WHO performance status of 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two arms. The study population 
comprised patients with technically unresectable disease, patients with low probability of surgical cure 
and patients aiming at organ preservation. The efficacy and safety evaluation solely addressed survival 
endpoints and the success of organ preservation was not formally addressed. Patients on the docetaxel 
arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m² by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) 
100 mg/m² administered as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the continuous 
intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m²/day from day 1 to day 4. The cycles were 
repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to receive 
chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per protocol (TPF/CRT). Patients on the comparator arm received 
cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m² as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by the 
continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m²/day from day 1 to day 5. The cycles 
were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to 
receive CRT as per protocol (PF/CRT).  
Patients in both treatment arms were to receive 7 weeks of CRT following induction chemotherapy 
with a minimum interval of 3 weeks and no later than 8 weeks after start of the last cycle (day 22 to 
day 56 of last cycle). During radiotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 1.5) was given weekly as a one-hour 
intravenous infusion for a maximum of 7 doses. Radiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment 
using once daily fractionation (2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks, for a total dose of 
70-72 Gy). Surgery on the primary site of disease and/or neck could be considered at anytime 
following completion of CRT. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the study received 
prophylactic antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study, overall survival (OS) was 
significantly longer (log-rank test, p = 0.0058) with the docetaxel-containing regimen compared to PF 
(median OS: 70.6 versus 30.1 months respectively), with a 30% risk reduction in mortality compared 
to PF (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.90) with an overall median 
follow up time of 41.9 months. The secondary endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a 29% risk reduction of 
progression or death and a 22 month improvement in median PFS (35.5 months for TPF and 13.1 for 
PF). This was also statistically significant with an HR of 0.71; 95% CI 0.56-0.90; log-rank test 
p = 0.004. Efficacy results are presented in the table below:

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel have been evaluated in cancer patients after administration of 20-
115 mg/m2 in phase I studies. The kinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent with 
a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model with half lives for the α, β and γ (terminal) phases of 
4 min, 36 min and between 11.1 h and 17.5 h, respectively, when sampled up to 24 hours. An 
additional study assessing the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel at similar doses (75 – 100 mg/m2) in 
patients, but over a longer time interval (over 22 days) found a longer mean terminal elimination 
halflife between 91 and 120 hours. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of 
docetaxel from the peripheral compartment. 
Distribution 
Following the administration of a 100 mg/m2 dose given as a one-hour infusion a mean peak plasma 
level of 3.7 μg/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.6 h.μg/ml. Mean values for total body 
clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter 
individual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% 
bound to plasma proteins.  
Elimination 
A study of 14C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in 
both the urine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl 
ester group, within seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of 
the administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is 
excreted during the first 48 hours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites 
and very low amounts of unchanged medicinal product. 
89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Age and gender 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from phase I 
studies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient. 
Hepatic impairment 
In a small number of patients (n = 23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver 
function impairment (ALT, AST ≥ 1.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase ≥ 2.5 
times the ULN), total clearance was lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2). 
Fluid retention 
Docetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to moderate fluid retention and there are 
no data available in patients with severe fluid retention. 
Combination therapy 
Doxorubicin 
When used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma 
levels of doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin 
and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their co-administration.  
Capecitabine 
Phase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice versa 
showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no 
effect by docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5'-DFUR.  
Cisplatin 
Clearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed following 
monotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel infusion is 
similar to that observed with cisplatin alone.  
Cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil 
The combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid 
tumours had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product.  
Prednisone and dexamethasone 
The effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard 
dexamethasone premedication has been studied in 42 patients. 
Prednisone 
No effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. 
5.3  
Preclinical safety data 
The carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. 
Docetaxel has been shown to be genotoxic by an aneugnic mechanism in the in vitro micronucleus and 
chromosome aberration test in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. 
However, it did not induce mutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. 
These results are consistent with the pharmacological activity of docetaxel.  
90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Undesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair 
male fertility.

Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
DOCETAXEL KABI is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, 
caution should be exercised when handling it and preparing the solution. The use of gloves is 
recommended. 
If DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, wash 
immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate or infusion 
solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately and thoroughly with 
water. 
Preparation for the intravenous administration 
Preparation of the infusion solution 
DO NOT use other docetaxel medicinal products consisting of 2 vials (concentrate and solvent) 
with this medicinal product (DOCETAXEL KABI 80 mg/4 ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion, which contains only 1 vial). 
DOCETAXEL KABI 80 mg/4 ml concentrate for solution for infusion requires NO prior 
dilution with a solvent and is ready to add to the infusion solution. 
Each vial is for single use and should be used immediately. 
If the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required number of boxes of DOCETAXEL KABI 
concentrate for solution for infusion to stand below 25°C for 5 minutes before use. More than one vial 
of DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate for solution for infusion may be necessary to obtain the required 
dose for the patient. Aseptically withdraw the required amount of DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate 
for solution for infusion using a calibrated syringe.  
In DOCETAXEL KABI 80 mg/4 ml vial the concentration of docetaxel is 20 mg/ml. 
The  required  volume  of  DOCETAXEL  KABI  concentrate  for  solution  for infusion  must be  injected 
via  a  single  injection  (one  shot)  into  a  250 ml  infusion  bag  or  bottle  containing  either  5%  glucose 
solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. 
If a dose greater than 190 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so 
that a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. 
Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. 
The infusion bag solution should be used within 6 hours below 25°C including the one hour infusion 
to the patient. 
As with all parenteral products, DOCETAXEL KABI infusion solution should be visually inspected 
prior to use, and solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. 
Docetaxel infusion solution is supersaturated, therefore may crystallize over time. If crystals appear, 
the solution must no longer be used and shall be discarded. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The use of docetaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy and it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the 
use of anticancer chemotherapy (see section 6.6). 
 Posology 
For breast, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers, premedication consisting of an oral 
corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to 
docetaxel administration, unless contraindicated, can be used (see section 4.4).  
For metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone or 
prednisolone the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours 
and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). 
For metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, irrespective of the concurrent use of prednisone or 
prednisolone, the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg 12 hours, 3 hours, 
and 1 hour before docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). 
Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. 
Docetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks.  
Breast cancer 
In the adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive and node-negative breast cancer, the recommended 
dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 
500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (TAC regimen) (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). 
For the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose 
95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 in monotherapy. In first-line treatment, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 is given in 
combination therapy with doxorubicin (50 mg/m2). 
In combination with trastuzumab the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 every three weeks, 
with trastuzumab administered weekly. In the pivotal study the initial docetaxel infusion was started 
the day following the first dose of trastuzumab. The subsequent docetaxel doses were administered 
immediately after completion of the trastuzumab infusion, if the preceding dose of trastuzumab was 
well tolerated. For trastuzumab dose and administration, see trastuzumab summary of product 
characteristics.  
In combination with capecitabine, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every three weeks, 
combined with capecitabine at 1250 mg/m2 twice daily (within 30 minutes after a meal) for 2 weeks 
followed by a 1-week rest period. For capecitabine dose calculation according to body surface area, 
see capecitabine summary of product characteristics.  
Non-small cell lung cancer 
In chemotherapy naïve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen 
is docetaxel 75 mg/m2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment 
after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m² as a single 
agent. 
Prostate cancer 
Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer  
The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2. Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily 
is administered continuously (see section 5.1). 
Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Prednisone or 
prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily may be administered continuously. 
Gastric adenocarcinoma 
The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion, followed by cisplatin 
75 mg/m2, as a 1- to 3- hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m2 per 
day given as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion. 
Treatment is repeated every three weeks. Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and 
appropriate hydration for cisplatin administration. Prophylactic G-CSF should be used to mitigate the 
risk of haematological toxicities (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). 
Head and neck cancer 
Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and appropriate hydration (prior to and after 
cisplatin administration). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological 
toxicities. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the TAX 323 and TAX 324 studies, received 
prophylactic antibiotics. 
• 
• 
Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX 323) 
For the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head 
and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion 
followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a 
continuous infusion at 750 mg/m2 per day for five days. This regimen is administered every 
3 weeks for 4 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should receive radiotherapy. 
Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX 324) 
For the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low 
probability of surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour 
intravenous infusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered as a 30-minute to 
3-hour infusion, followed by 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion from day 1 
96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to day 4. This regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. Following chemotherapy, 
patients should receive chemoradiotherapy. 
For cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose modifications, see the corresponding summary of product 
characteristics. 
Dose adjustments during treatment 
General 
Docetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3. 
In patients who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3 for more than 
one week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel 
therapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 and/or from 75 to 
60 mg/m². If the patient continues to experience these reactions at 60 mg/m², the treatment should be 
discontinued. 
Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer 
Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive docetaxel, doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide (TAC) adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Patients who experience febrile 
neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection should have their docetaxel dose reduced to 60 mg/m² in all 
subsequent cycles (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis should 
have their dose decreased to 60 mg/m². 
In combination with cisplatin 
For patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose 
nadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is < 25,000 cells/mm3, or in patients who 
experience febrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-haematologic toxicities, the docetaxel 
dose in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg/m2. For cisplatin dose adjustments, see the 
corresponding summary of product characteristics.  
In combination with capecitabine 
•  For capecitabine dose modifications, see capecitabine summary of product characteristics. 
•  For patients developing the first appearance of  Grade 2 toxicity, which persists at the time of the 
next docetaxel/capecitabine treatment, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, and resume at 
100% of the original dose. 
•  For patients developing the second appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, or the first appearance of 
Grade 3 toxicity, at any time during the treatment cycle, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 
0-1 and then resume treatment with docetaxel 55 mg/m². 
•  For any subsequent appearances of toxicities, or any Grade 4 toxicities, discontinue the docetaxel 
dose. 
For trastuzumab dose modifications, see trastuzumab summary of product characteristics. 
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil 
If an episode of febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection occurs despite 
G-CSF use, the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. If subsequent episodes of 
complicated neutropenia occur the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 60 to 45 mg/m2. In case of 
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. Patients should 
not be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until neutrophils recover to a level 
>1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level >100,000 cells/mm3. Discontinue treatment if these 
toxicities persist (see section 4.4).

characteristics. 
In the pivotal SCCHN studies patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged 
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide 
prophylactic coverage (eg, day 6-15) in all subsequent cycles. 
Special populations 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Based on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/m² as single agent, patients who have both 
elevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal 
range (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of 
docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin > ULN and/or 
ALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase > 6 times the ULN, no 
dose-reduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. 
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric 
adenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 × ULN 
associated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 × ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no 
dose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No 
data are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other 
indications.  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of DOCETAXEL KABI in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged 
1 month to less than 18 years have not yet been established. 
There is no relevant use of DOCETAXEL KABI in the paediatric population in the indications breast 
cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma and head and neck cancer, not 
including type II and III less differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 
Elderly  
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in the elderly. 
In combination with capecitabine, for patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of 
capecitabine to 75% is recommended (see capecitabine summary of product characteristics). 
Method of administration 
For instructions on preparation and administration of the product, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
98 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with baseline neutrophil count of < 1,500 cells/mm3. 
Patients with severe liver impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Contraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
For breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as 
dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel 
administration, unless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well 
as the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral 
dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2). 
Haematology 
Neutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median 
of 7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of 
complete blood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be 
retreated with docetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). 
In the case of severe neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of 
docetaxel therapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate 
symptomatic measures are recommended (see section 4.2). 
In patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile 
neutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic 
G-CSF. Patients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of 
complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). 
Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
In patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), 
febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received 
primary G-CSF prophylaxis. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive 
adjuvant therapy with TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile 
neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TAC should be 
closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Gastrointestinal reactions 
Caution is recommended for patients with neutropenia, particularly at risk for developing 
gastrointestinal complications. Although majority of cases occurred during the first or second cycle of 
docetaxel containing regimen, enterocolitis could develop at any time, and could lead to death as early 
as on the first day of onset. Patients should be closely monitored for early manifestations of serious 
gastrointestinal toxicity (see sections 4.2, 4.4 Haematology, and 4.8). 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and 
second infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation 
of the infusion of docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should 
be available. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised 
cutaneous reactions do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe 
hypotension, bronchospasm or generalised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of 
docetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions 
should not be re-challenged with docetaxel. Patients who have previously experienced a 
99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel may be at risk to develop hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel, 
including more severe hypersensitivity reaction. These patients should be closely monitored during 
initiation of docetaxel therapy. 
Cutaneous reactions 
Localised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema 
followed by desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by 
desquamation which lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see 
section 4.2). 
Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic 
Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) have been 
reported with docetaxel treatment. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of 
serious skin manifestations and closely monitored. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions 
appear discontinuation of docetaxel should be considered. 
Fluid retention 
Patients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be 
monitored closely. 
Respiratory disorders 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, 
pulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure have been reported and may be associated with fatal 
outcome. Cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant 
radiotherapy. 
If new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop, patients should be closely monitored, promptly 
investigated, and appropriately treated. Interruption of docetaxel therapy is recommended until 
diagnosis is available. Early use of supportive care measures may help improve the condition. The 
benefit of resuming docetaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated. 
Patients with liver impairment 
In patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels 
(ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels 
greater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as 
toxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, 
infections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel 
in those patients with elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m2 and LFTs should be measured at 
baseline and before each cycle (see section 4.2). 
For patients with serum bilirubin levels > ULN and/or ALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN concurrent 
with serum alkaline phosphatase levels > 6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended 
and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. 
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric 
adenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 × ULN 
associated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 × ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no 
dose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No 
data are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other 
indications.  
Patients with renal impairment 
There are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel. 
100 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nervous system 
The development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2). 
Cardiac toxicity 
Heart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, 
particularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may 
be moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8). 
When patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they 
should undergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during 
treatment (e.g. every three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For 
more details see summary of product characteristics of trastuzumab.  
Ventricular arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia (sometimes fatal) has been reported in 
patients treated with docetaxel in combination regimens including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and/ or 
cyclophosphamide (see section 4.8).  
Baseline cardiac assessment is recommended.   
Eye disorders 
Cystoid macular oedema (CMO) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with 
impaired vision should undergo a prompt and complete ophthalmologic examination. In case CMO is 
diagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated (see section 
4.8). 
Second primary malignancies 
Second primary malignancies have been reported when docetaxel was given in combination with 
anticancer treatments known to be associated with second primary malignancies.  Second primary 
malignancies (including acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma) may occur several months or years after docetaxel-containing therapy. Patients should be 
monitored for second primary malignancies (see section 4.8). 
Tumour Lysis Syndrome 
Tumour lysis syndrome has been reported with docetaxel after the first or the second cycle (see section 
4.8). Patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome (e.g. with renal impairment, hyperuricemia, bulky 
tumour, rapid progression) should be closely monitored. Correction of dehydration and treatment of 
high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of treatment. 
Others 
Women of childbearing potential must use contraceptive measures during treatment and for 2 months 
after cessation of treatment with docetaxel. Men must use contraceptive measures during treatment 
and for 4 months after cessation of treatment with docetaxel (see section 4.6). 
The concomitant use of docetaxel with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and 
voriconazole) should be avoided (see section 4.5). 
Additional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer 
Complicated neutropenia 
For patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or 
infection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). 
101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gastrointestinal reactions 
Symptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, 
may be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated 
promptly. 
Congestive heart failure (CHF) 
Patients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the 
follow up period. In patients treated with the TAC regimen for node positive breast cancer, the risk of 
CHF has been shown to be higher during the first year after treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Patients with 4+ nodes 
As the benefit observed in patient with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on disease-free 
survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with 4+ 
nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis (see section 5.1). 
Elderly  
Cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer 
There are limited data available in patients > 70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with 
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. 
Cautions for use in castration-resistant prostate cancer 
Of the 333 patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks in a prostate cancer study (TAX 327), 
209 patients were 65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients 
treated with docetaxel every three weeks, the incidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate 
≥ 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients. The 
incidence of related fever, diarrhoea, anorexia, and peripheral oedema occurred at rates ≥ 10% higher 
in patients who were 75 years of age or greater versus less than 65 years. 
Cautions for use in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
Of the 545 patients treated with docetaxel every 3 weeks in a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer study 
(STAMPEDE), 296 patients were 65 years of age or older, and 48 patients were 75 years of age or 
older. More patients aged ≥65 years in the docetaxel arm reported hypersensitivity reaction, 
neutropenia, anaemia, fluid retention, dyspnea, and nail changes when compared to the patients aged 
less than 65 years. None of these increases in frequency reached 10% difference with the control arm. 
In patients who were 75 years of age or older, when compared to younger patients, neutropenia, 
anaemia, diarrhea, dyspnea and upper respiratory tract infection were reported with a greater incidence 
(at least 10% higher).  
Cautions for use in gastric adenocarcinoma cancer 
Among the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) 
patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer 
study, 74 were 65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of 
serious adverse events was higher in older people compared to younger patients. The incidence of the 
following adverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection occurred at rates 
≥ 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients. 
Elderly treated with TCF should be closely monitored. 
Excipients 
This medicine contains 2.37 g of alcohol (ethanol) in each 6 ml which is equivalent to 39.5% w/v. The 
amount in 9 ml of dose is equivalent to 88.9 ml of beer and 35.6 ml of wine. 
Harmful for those suffering from alcoholism. 
To be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women, children and high-risk groups 
such as patients with liver disease, or epilepsy. 
102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Because this medicine is usually given slowly over 1 hours, the effects of alcohol may be reduced. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may alter the effects of other medicinal products. 
Co-administration with medicines containing e.g.propylene glycol or ethanol may lead to 
accumulation of ethanol and induce adverse effects, in particular in young children with low or 
immature metabolic capacity. 
In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant 
administration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the 
enzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as ciclosporine, ketoconazole and erythromycin. As 
a result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with these medicinal products as 
concomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction. 
In case of combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors, the occurrence of docetaxel adverse reactions may 
increase, as a result of reduced metabolism. If the concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin and voriconazole) cannot be avoided, a close clinical surveillance is warranted and a 
dose-adjustment of docetaxel may be suitable during the treatment with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor 
(see section 4.4). In a pharmacokinetic study with 7 patients, the co-administration of docetaxel with 
the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole leads to a significant decrease in docetaxel clearance by 
49%. 
Docetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic 
prostate cancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4. 
No statistically significant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. 
Docetaxel is highly protein bound (> 95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with 
concomitantly administered medicinal product has not been investigated formally, in vitro interactions 
with tightly protein-bound agents such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, propafenone, 
phenytoin, salicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein binding of 
docetaxel. In addition, dexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. Docetaxel did not 
influence the binding of digitoxin. 
The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their 
co-administration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction 
between docetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was 
about 50% higher than values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/ Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential and men receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming 
pregnant, and not to father a child and to inform the treating physician immediately should this occur.  
Due to the genptpxic risk of docetaxel (see section 5.3), women of childbearing potential must use 
effective method of contraception during treatment and for 2 months after cessation of treatment with 
docetaxel. Men must use effective method of contraception during treatment and for 4 months after 
cessation of treatment with docetaxel. 
103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
There is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be 
both embryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats. As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, 
docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Therefore, docetaxel must 
not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated.  
Breast-feeding 
Docetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. 
Consequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be 
discontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy. 
Fertility 
Studies in animals have shown that docetaxel may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). Therefore, 
males being treated with docetaxel must seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. The amount of 
alcohol in this medicinal product and the side effects of the product may impair the ability to drive or 
use machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Therefore, patients should be warned of the potential impact 
of the amount of alcohol and the side effects of this medicinal product on the ability to drive or use 
machines, and be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience these side effects during 
treatment. 
4.8  Undesirable effects

These reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; 
grade 3-4 = G3/4; grade 4 = G4), the COSTART and the MedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined as: 
very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available 
data). 
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was 
reversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe 
neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea 
and asthenia. The severity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in 
combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. 
For combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in ≥ 10% are displayed. There 
was an increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the 
trastuzumab combination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. 
For combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects (≥ 5%) 
reported in a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see 
capecitabine summary of product characteristics). 
For combination with ADT and with prednisone or prednisolone (STAMPEDE study), adverse events 
occurring over the 6 cycles of treatment with docetaxel and having at least 2% higher incidence in the 
docetaxel treatment arm by comparison to the control arm, are presented, using the CTCAE grading 
scale. 
The following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel:  
Immune system disorders 
Hypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the 
infusion of docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms 
were flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills. 
Severe reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized 
rash/erythema (see section 4.4). 
Nervous system disorders 
The development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4). Mild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paraesthesia, dysesthesia or pain 
including burning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Reversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to 
moderate. Reactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and 
hands (including severe hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently 
associated with pruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. 
Less frequently, severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to 
interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe 
nail disorders are characterised by hypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyper pigmentation, inflammation, 
redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis or extravasation and swelling of the vein.  
Fluid retention includes events such as peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, 
pericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain. The peripheral oedema usually starts at the lower 
105 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
extremities and may become generalised with a weight gain of 3 kg or more. Fluid retention is 
cumulative in incidence and severity (see section 4.4).

Description of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for DOCETAXEL KABI 100 mg/m² single 
agent 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Rare: bleeding episodes associated with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia.  
Nervous system disorders 
Reversibility data are available among 35.3% of patients who developed neurotoxicity following 
docetaxel treatment at 100 mg/m² as single agent. The events were spontaneously reversible within 
3 months. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Very rare: one case of alopecia non-reversible at the end of the study. 73% of the cutaneous reactions 
were reversible within 21 days. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation was more than 1,000 mg/m2 and the median 
time to fluid retention reversibility was 16.4 weeks (range 0 to 42 weeks). The onset of moderate and 
severe retention is delayed (median cumulative dose: 818.9 mg/m2) in patients with premedication 
compared with patients without premedication (median cumulative dose: 489.7 mg/m2); however, it 
has been reported in some patients during the early courses of therapy.

Description of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for DOCETAXEL KABI 100 mg/m² in 
combination with trastuzumab 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Very common: Haematological toxicity was increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and 
docetaxel, compared with docetaxel alone (32% grade 3/4 neutropenia versus 22%, using NCI-CTC 
criteria). Note that this is likely to be an underestimate since docetaxel alone at a dose of 100 mg/m2 is 
known to result in neutropenia in 97% of patients, 76% grade 4, based on nadir blood counts. The 
incidence of febrile neutropenia/neutropenic sepsis was also increased in patients treated with 
Herceptin plus docetaxel (23% versus 17% for patients treated with docetaxel alone). 
Cardiac disorders 
Symptomatic cardiac failure was reported in 2.2% of the patients who received docetaxel plus 
trastuzumab compared to 0% of patients given docetaxel alone. In the docetaxel plus trastuzumab arm, 
64% had received a prior anthracycline as adjuvant therapy compared with 55% in the docetaxel arm 
alone.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There were a few reports of overdose. There is no known antidote for docetaxel overdose. In case of 
overdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and vital functions closely monitored. In 
cases of overdose, exacerbation of adverse events may be expected. The primary anticipated 
complications of overdose would consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity and 
mucositis. Patients should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose. 
Other appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken, as needed.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, plant alkaloids and other natural products, taxanes, 
ATC Code: L01CD02  
Mechanism of action 
Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable 
microtubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The 
binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. 
Docetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for 
vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and 
against freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular 
concentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some 
but not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance 
gene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental anti-tumour 
activity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Breast cancer 
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide: adjuvant therapy 
Patients with operable node-positive breast cancer (TAX 316) 
Data from a multi-centre open-label randomised study support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant 
treatment of patients with operable node-positive breast cancer and KPS ≥ 80%, between 18 and 
70 years of age. After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 
4+), 1491 patients were randomised to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after 
doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 
followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FAC arm). Both regimens 
were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, 
all other medicinal products were given as intravenous bolus on day one. G-CSF was administered as 
secondary prophylaxis to patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, 
prolonged neutropenia, or infection). Patients on the TAC arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with 
ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. In 
both arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with positive oestrogen and/or progesterone 
receptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed 
according to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 69% of patients who 
received TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC. Two interim analyses and one final analysis 
were performed. The first interim analysis was planned 3 years after the date when half of study 
enrolment was done. The second interim analysis was done after 400 DFS events had been recorded 
overall, which led to a median follow-up of 55 months. The final analysis was performed when all 
patients had reached their 10-year follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow 
up before). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) 
was the secondary efficacy endpoint. 
A final analysis was performed with an actual median follow up of 96 months. Significantly longer 
disease-free survival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. Incidence of 
relapses at 10 years was reduced in patients receiving TAC compared to those who received FAC 
(39% versus 45%, respectively) i.e. an absolute risk reduction by 6% (p = 0.0043). Overall survival at 
10 years was also significantly increased with TAC compared to FAC (76% versus 69%, respectively) 
i.e. an absolute reduction of the risk of death by 7% (p = 0.002). As the benefit observed in patients 
with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on DFS and OS, the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC 
in patients with 4+ nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis. 
Overall, the study results demonstrate a positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC.

Patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy (GEICAM 9805) 
Data from a multi-centre open-label randomised trial support the use of DOCETAXEL KABI for the 
adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive 
chemotherapy. 1060 patients were randomised to receive either DOCETAXEL KABI 75 mg/m2 
administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (539 patients in 
TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 
500 mg/m2 (521 patients in FAC arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable node-negative breast cancer 
patients with high risk of relapse according to 1998 St. Gallen criteria (tumour size > 2 cm and/or 
negative ER and PR and/or high histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and /or age < 35 years).). 
Both regimens were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. DOCETAXEL KABI was 
administered as a 1-hour infusion, all other medicinal products were given intraveinously on day 1 
every three weeks. Primary prophylactic G-CSF was made mandatory in TAC arm after 230 patients 
were randomised. The incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection 
was decreased in patients who received primary G-CSF prophylaxis (see section 4.8). In both arms, 
after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ tumours received tamoxifen 
20 mg once a day for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was administered according to 
guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 57.3% of patients who received TAC 
and 51.2% of patients who received FAC. 
One primary analysis and one updated analysis were performed. The primary analysis was done when 
all patients had a follow-up of greater than 5 years (median follow-up time of 77 months). The updated 
analysis was performed when all patients had reached their 10-year (median follow up time of 10 
years and 5 months) follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow-up 
previously). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) 
was the secondary efficacy endpoint. 
Athe median duration of follow-up was 77 months, significantly longer disease-free survival for the 
TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in 
the risk of relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), 
p = 0.01).  At the median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 16,5% 
reduction in the risk of relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% CI 
(0.65-1.08), p=0.1646). DFS data were not statistically significant but were still associated with a 
positive trend in favour of TAC. 
At the median follow-up time of 77 months, overall survival (OS) was longer in the TAC arm with 
TAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk of death compared to FAC (hazard ratio = 
0.76, 95% CI (0.46-1.26, p = 0.29). However, the distribution of OS was not significantly different 
between the 2 groups. 
At the median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 9% reduction in 
the risk of death compared to FAC-treated patients (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% CI (0.63-1.32)).  
The survival rate was 93.7% in the TAC arm and 91.4 % in the FAC arm, at the 8-year follow-up time 
point, and 91.3 % in the TAC arm and 89 % in the FAC arm, at the 10-year follow-up time point. 
The positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC remained unchanged. 
TAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were analysed 
in the primary ana lysis (at the median follow-up time of 77 months) (see table below):

DOCETAXEL KABI as single agent 
Two randomised phase III comparative studies, involving a total of 326 alkylating or 
392 anthracycline failure metastatic breast cancer patients, have been performed with docetaxel at the 
recommended dose and regimen of 100 mg/m² every 3 weeks. 
In alkylating-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to doxorubicin (75 mg/m² every 3 weeks). 
Without affecting overall survival time (docetaxel 15 months vs. doxorubicin 14 months, p = 0.38) or 
time to progression (docetaxel 27 weeks vs. doxorubicin 23 weeks, p = 0.54), docetaxel increased

response rate (52% vs. 37%, p = 0.01) and shortened time to response (12 weeks vs. 23 weeks, 
p= 0.007). Three docetaxel patients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas 
15 doxorubicin patients (9%) discontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart 
failure). 
In anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and 
vinblastine (12 mg/m² every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m² every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate 
(33% vs. 12%, p < 0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p= 0.0004) and 
prolonged overall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p= 0.01). 
During these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety profile 
observed in phase II studies (see section 4.8). 
An open-label,  multi centre, randomised phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel 
monotherapy and paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous 
therapy should have included an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomised to receive 
either docetaxel monotherapy 100 mg/m² as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m² as a 3 hour 
infusion. Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks. 
Without affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p = 0.10), docetaxel 
prolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p < 0.01) and median survival 
(15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p = 0.03). 
More grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to 
paclitaxel (23.0%). 
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with doxorubicin 
One large randomised phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic 
disease, has been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/m²) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m²) 
(AT arm) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/m²) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m²) (AC 
arm). Both regimens were administered on day 1 every 3 weeks.  
•  Time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.0138. 
The median TTP was 37.3 weeks (95% CI: 33.4 - 42.1) in AT arm and 31.9 weeks (95% CI: 27.4 - 
36.0) in AC arm.  
•  Overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.009. 
The ORR was 59.3% (95% CI: 52.8 - 65.9) in AT arm versus 46.5% (95% CI: 39.8 - 53.2) in AC 
arm.  
In this study, AT arm showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile 
neutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), infection (8% versus 2.4%), diarrhoea (7.5% versus 1.4%), asthenia 
(8.5% versus 2.4%), and pain (2.8% versus 0%) than AC arm. On the other hand, AC arm showed a 
higher incidence of severe anaemia (15.8% versus 8.5%) than AT arm, and, in addition, a higher 
incidence of severe cardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF 
decrease ≥ 20% (13.1% versus 6.1%), absolute LVEF decrease ≥ 30% (6.2% versus 1.1%). Toxic 
deaths occurred in 1 patient in the AT arm (congestive heart failure) and in 4 patients in the AC arm 
(1 due to septic shock and 3 due to congestive heart failure).  
In both arms, quality of life measured by the EORTC questionnaire was comparable and stable during 
treatment and follow-up.  
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with trastuzumab 
Docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab was studied for the treatment of patients with metastatic 
breast cancer whose tumours overexpress HER2, and who previously had not received chemotherapy 
for metastatic disease. One hundred eighty six patients were randomised to receive docetaxel 
(100 mg/m2) with or without trastuzumab; 60% of patients received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant 
chemotherapy. Docetaxel plus trastuzumab was efficacious in patients whether or not they had 
received prior adjuvant anthracyclines. The main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in 
this pivotal study was immunohistochemistry (IHC). A minority of patients were tested using 
126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). In this study, 87% of patients had disease that was IHC 3+, 
and 95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC 3+ and/or FISH positive. Efficacy results are

DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with capecitabine 
Data from one multi-centre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical study support the use of 
docetaxel in combination with capecitabine for treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy, including an anthracycline. In this 
study, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous 
infusion every 3 weeks) and capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week 
rest period). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/m2 as a 1 hour 
intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine 
combination arm (p = 0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 352 days 
(docetaxel alone). The overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator 
assessment) were 41.6% (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to 
progressive disease was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine combination arm (p < 0.0001). The 
median time to progression was 186 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
Patients previously treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy 
In a phase III study, in previously treated patients, time to progression (12.3 weeks versus 7 weeks) 
and overall survival were significantly longer for docetaxel at 75 mg/m² compared to Best Supportive 
Care. The 1-year survival rate was also significantly longer in docetaxel (40%) versus BSC (16%). 
There was less use of morphinic analgesic (p < 0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p < 0.01), other 
disease-related medicinal products (p = 0.06) and radiotherapy (p < 0.01) in patients treated with 
docetaxel at 75 mg/m² compared to those with BSC.  
The overall response rate was 6.8% in the evaluable patients, and the median duration of response was 
26.1 weeks.  
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with platinum agents in chemotherapy-naïve patients 
In a phase III study, 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or 
greater, and who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either 
docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/m2 over 
30-60 minutes every 3 weeks (TCis), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with 
carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/ml.min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/m2

Prostate cancer 
Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone in patients with 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were evaluated in a randomised multi-centre phase III 
study (TAX 327). A total of 1006 patients with KPS ≥ 60 were randomised to the following treatment 
groups:  
•  Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. 
•  Docetaxel 30 mg/m2 administered weekly for the first 5 weeks in a 6 week cycle for 5 cycles. 
•  Mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. 
All 3 regimens were administered in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily, 
continuously. 
Patients who received docetaxel every three weeks demonstrated significantly longer overall survival 
compared to those treated with mitoxantrone. The increase in survival seen in the docetaxel weekly 
arm was not statistically significant compared to the mitoxantrone control arm. Efficacy endpoints for 
the docetaxel arms versus the control arm are summarized in the following table:

Given the fact that docetaxel every week presented a slightly better safety profile than docetaxel every 
3 weeks, it is possible that certain patients may benefit from docetaxel every week.  
No statistical differences were observed between treatment groups for Global Quality of Life. 
Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
STAMPEDE study 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel administered concomitantly with standard of care (ADT) in 
patients with high-risk locally advanced or metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer were 
evaluated in a randomised multi-centre, multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) study with a seamless phase 
II/III design (STAMPEDE – MRC PR08). A total of 1776 male patients were allocated to the 
treatment arms of interest:  
•  Standard of care + docetaxel 75 mg/m², administered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles 
•  Standard of care alone  
Docetaxel regimen was administered in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily 
continuously.  
Among the 1776 randomised patients 1086 (61%) had metastatic disease, 362 were randomised to 
docetaxel in combination with standard of care, 724 received standard of care alone.  
In these metastatic prostate cancer patients, the median overall survival was significantly longer in 
docetaxel treatment groups than in the standard of care alone group, with a median overall survival 19 
months longer with the addition of docetaxel to standard of care (HR =  0.76, 95% CI = 0.62-0.92, 
p=0.005).

CHAARTED study 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel administered at the beginning of androgen-deprivation therapy 
(ADT) in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer were evaluated in a randomised 
Phase III multi-centre study (CHAARTED). A total of 790 male patients were allocated to the 2 
treatment groups.  
•  ADT + docetaxel 75 mg/m² given at the beginning of ADT, administered every 3 weeks 
for 6 cycles 
•  ADT alone   
The median overall survival was significantly longer in docetaxel treatment group than in the ADT 
alone group, with a median overall survival 13.6 months longer with the addition of docetaxel to ADT 
(hazard ratio (HR) = 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.47-0.80, p=0.0003).

Gastric adenocarcinoma 
A multi-centre, open-label, randomised study, was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
docetaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including 
adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who had not received prior chemotherapy for 
metastatic disease. A total of 445 patients with KPS > 70 were treated with either docetaxel (T) 
131 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(75 mg/m2 on day 1) in combination with cisplatin (C) (75 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (F) 
(750 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) or cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 per 
day for 5 days). The length of a treatment cycle was 3 weeks for the TCF arm and 4 weeks for the CF 
arm. The median number of cycles administered per patient was 6 (with a range of 1-16) for the TCF 
arm compared to 4 (with a range of 1-12) for the CF arm. Time to progression (TTP) was the primary 
endpoint. The risk reduction of progression was 32.1% and was associated with a significantly longer 
TTP (p = 0.0004) in favour of the TCF arm. Overall survival was also significantly longer 
(p = 0.0201) in favour of the TCF arm with a risk reduction of mortality of 22.7%. Efficacy results are

Subgroup analyses across age, gender and race consistently favoured the TCF arm compared to the CF 
arm.  
A survival update analysis conducted with a median follow-up time of 41.6 months no longer showed 
a statistically significant difference although always in favour of the TCF regimen and showed that the 
benefit of TCF over CF is clearly observed between 18 and 30 months of follow up.  
Overall, quality of life (QoL) and clinical benefit results consistently indicated improvement in favour 
of the TCF arm. Patients treated with TCF had a longer time to 5% definitive deterioration of global 
health status on the QLQ-C30 questionnaire (p = 0.0121) and a longer time to definitive worsening of 
Karnofsky performance status (p = 0.0088) compared to patients treated with CF. 
Head and neck cancer 
Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX323)  
• 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a phase III, multi-centre, open-label, 
randomised study (TAX323). In this study, 358 patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN, 
and WHO performance status 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two treatment arms. Patients on the 
docetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin (P) 75 mg/m2 followed by 
5-fluorouracil (F) 750 mg/m2 per day as a continuous infusion for 5 days. This regimen was 
administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at least a minor response (≥ 25% reduction in 
bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with 
132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not 
progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (TPF/RT). 
Patients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m2 followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) 
1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days. This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case 
at least a minor response (≥ 25% reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed 
after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval 
of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to 
institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (PF/RT). Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either 
with a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy - 2.0 Gy once a day, 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to 
70 Gy), or accelerated/hyperfractionated regimens of radiation therapy (twice a day, with a minimum 
interfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week). A total of 70 Gy was recommended for accelerated 
regimens and 74 Gy for hyperfractionated schemes. Surgical resection was allowed following 
chemotherapy, before or after radiotherapy. Patients on the TPF arm received antibiotic prophylaxis 
with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. 
The primary endpoint in this study, progression-free survival (PFS), was significantly longer in the 
TPF arm compared to the PF arm, p = 0.0042 (median PFS: 11.4 vs. 8.3 months respectively) with an 
overall median follow up time of 33.7 months. Median overall survival was also significantly longer in 
favour of the TPF arm compared to the PF arm (median OS: 18.6 vs. 14.5 months respectively) with a 
28% risk reduction of mortality, p = 0.0128. Efficacy results are presented in the table below:

Quality of life parameters 
Patients treated with TPF experienced significantly less deterioration of their Global health score 
compared to those treated with PF (p = 0.01, using the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale). 
Clinical benefit parameters 
The performance status scale, for head and neck (PSS-HN) subscales designed to measure 
understandability of speech, ability to eat in public, and normalcy of diet, was significantly in favour 
of TPF as compared to PF. 
Median time to first deterioration of WHO performance status was significantly longer in the TPF arm 
compared to PF. Pain intensity score improved during treatment in both groups indicating adequate 
pain management.  
Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX324)  
• 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a randomised ,multi-centre 
open-label, phase III, study (TAX324). In this study, 501 patients, with locally advanced SCCHN, and 
a WHO performance status of 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two arms. The study population 
comprised patients with technically unresectable disease, patients with low probability of surgical cure 
and patients aiming at organ preservation. The efficacy and safety evaluation solely addressed survival 
endpoints and the success of organ preservation was not formally addressed. Patients on the docetaxel 
arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m² by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) 
100 mg/m² administered as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the continuous 
intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m²/day from day 1 to day 4. The cycles were 
repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to receive 
chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per protocol (TPF/CRT). Patients on the comparator arm received 
cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m² as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by the 
continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m²/day from day 1 to day 5. The cycles 
were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to 
receive CRT as per protocol (PF/CRT).  
Patients in both treatment arms were to receive 7 weeks of CRT following induction chemotherapy 
with a minimum interval of 3 weeks and no later than 8 weeks after start of the last cycle (day 22 to 
day 56 of last cycle). During radiotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 1.5) was given weekly as a one-hour 
intravenous infusion for a maximum of 7 doses. Radiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment 
using once daily fractionation (2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks, for a total dose of 
70-72 Gy). Surgery on the primary site of disease and/or neck could be considered at anytime 
following completion of CRT. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the study received 
prophylactic antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study, overall survival (OS) was 
significantly longer (log-rank test, p = 0.0058) with the docetaxel-containing regimen compared to PF 
(median OS: 70.6 versus 30.1 months respectively), with a 30% risk reduction in mortality compared 
to PF (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.90) with an overall median 
follow up time of 41.9 months. The secondary endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a 29% risk reduction of 
progression or death and a 22 month improvement in median PFS (35.5 months for TPF and 13.1 for 
PF). This was also statistically significant with an HR of 0.71; 95% CI 0.56-0.90; log-rank test 
p = 0.004. Efficacy results are presented in the table below:

Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel have been evaluated in cancer patients after administration of 20-
115 mg/m2 in phase I studies. The kinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent with 
a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model with half-lives for the α, β and γ (terminal) phases of 
4 min, 36 min and between 11.1 h and 17.5 h, respectively, when sampled up to 24 hours. An 
additional study assessing the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel at similar doses (75 – 100 mg/m2) in 
patients, but over a longer time interval (over 22 days) found a longer mean terminal elimination 
halflife between 91 and 120 hours. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of 
docetaxel from the peripheral compartment. 
Distribution 
Following the administration of a 100 mg/m2 dose given as a one-hour infusion a mean peak plasma 
level of 3.7 μg/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.6 h.μg/ml. Mean values for total body 
clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter 
individual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% 
bound to plasma proteins.  
Elimination 
A study of 14C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in 
both the urine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl 
ester group, within seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of 
the administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is 
excreted during the first 48 hours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites 
and very low amounts of unchanged medicinal product.

Special populations 
Age and gender 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from phase I 
studies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient. 
Hepatic impairment 
In a small number of patients (n = 23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver 
function impairment (ALT, AST ≥ 1.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase ≥ 2.5 
times the ULN), total clearance was lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2). 
Fluid retention 
Docetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to moderate fluid retention and there are 
no data available in patients with severe fluid retention. 
Combination therapy 
Doxorubicin 
When used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma 
levels of doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin 
and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their co-administration.  
Capecitabine 
Phase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice versa 
showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no 
effect by docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5'-DFUR.  
Cisplatin 
Clearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed following 
monotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel infusion is 
similar to that observed with cisplatin alone.  
Cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil 
The combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid 
tumours had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product.  
Prednisone and dexamethasone 
The effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard 
dexamethasone premedication has been studied in 42 patients. 
Prednisone 
No effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. 
5.3   Preclinical safety data 
The carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. 
Docetaxel has been shown to be genotoxic by an aneugenic mechanism in the in vitro micronucleus 
and chromosome aberration test in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. 
However, it did not induce mutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. 
These results are consistent with the pharmacological activity of docetaxel.  
Undesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair 
male fertility.

DOCETAXEL KABI is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, 
caution should be exercised when handling it and preparing the solution. The use of gloves is 
recommended. 
If DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, wash 
immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate or infusion 
solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately and thoroughly with 
water. 
Preparation for the intravenous administration 
Preparation of the infusion solution 
DO NOT use other docetaxel medicinal products consisting of 2 vials (concentrate and solvent) 
with this medicinal product (DOCETAXEL KABI 120 mg/6 ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion, which contains only 1 vial). 
DOCETAXEL KABI 120 mg/6 ml concentrate for solution for infusion requires NO prior 
dilution with a solvent and is ready to add to the infusion solution. 
Each vial is for single use and should be used immediately. 
If the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required number of boxes of DOCETAXEL KABI 
concentrate for solution for infusion to stand below 25°C for 5 minutes before use. More than one vial 
of DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate for solution for infusion may be necessary to obtain the required 
dose for the patient. Aseptically withdraw the required amount of DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate 
for solution for infusion using a calibrated syringe.  
In DOCETAXEL KABI 120 mg/6 ml vial the concentration of docetaxel is 20 mg/ml. 
The  required  volume  of  DOCETAXEL  KABI  concentrate  for  solution  for infusion  must be  injected 
via  a  single  injection  (one  shot)  into  a  250 ml  infusion  bag  or  bottle  containing  either  5%  glucose 
solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. 
If a dose greater than 190 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so 
that a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. 
Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. 
The infusion bag solution should be used within 6 hours below 25°C including the one hour infusion 
to the patient. 
As with all parenteral products, DOCETAXEL KABI infusion solution should be visually inspected 
prior to use, and solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. 
Docetaxel infusion solution is supersaturated, therefore may crystallize over time. If crystals appear, 
the solution must no longer be used and shall be discarded. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The use of docetaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy and it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the 
use of anticancer chemotherapy (see section 6.6). 
Posology 
For breast, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers, premedication consisting of an oral 
corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to 
docetaxel administration, unless contraindicated, can be used (see section 4.4).  
For metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone or 
prednisolone the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours 
and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). 
For metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, irrespective of the concurrent use of prednisone or 
prednisolone, the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg 12 hours, 3 hours, 
and 1 hour before docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). 
Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. 
Docetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks.  
Breast cancer 
In the adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive and node-negative breast cancer, the recommended 
dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 
500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (TAC regimen) (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). 
For the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose 
141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 in monotherapy. In first-line treatment, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 is given in 
combination therapy with doxorubicin (50 mg/m2). 
In combination with trastuzumab the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 every three weeks, 
with trastuzumab administered weekly. In the pivotal study the initial docetaxel infusion was started 
the day following the first dose of trastuzumab. The subsequent docetaxel doses were administered 
immediately after completion of the trastuzumab infusion, if the preceding dose of trastuzumab was 
well tolerated. For trastuzumab dose and administration, see trastuzumab summary of product 
characteristics.  
In combination with capecitabine, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every three weeks, 
combined with capecitabine at 1250 mg/m2 twice daily (within 30 minutes after a meal) for 2 weeks 
followed by a 1-week rest period. For capecitabine dose calculation according to body surface area, 
see capecitabine summary of product characteristics.  
Non-small cell lung cancer 
In chemotherapy naïve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen 
is docetaxel 75 mg/m2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment 
after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m² as a single 
agent. 
Prostate cancer 
Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer  
The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2. Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily 
is administered continuously (see section 5.1). 
Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Prednisone or 
prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily may be administered continuously. 
Gastric adenocarcinoma 
The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion, followed by cisplatin 
75 mg/m2, as a 1- to 3- hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m2 per 
day given as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion. 
Treatment is repeated every three weeks. Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and 
appropriate hydration for cisplatin administration. Prophylactic G-CSF should be used to mitigate the 
risk of haematological toxicities (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). 
Head and neck cancer 
Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and appropriate hydration (prior to and after 
cisplatin administration). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological 
toxicities. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the TAX 323 and TAX 324 studies, received 
prophylactic antibiotics. 
• 
• 
Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX 323) 
For the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head 
and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion 
followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a 
continuous infusion at 750 mg/m2 per day for five days. This regimen is administered every 
3 weeks for 4 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should receive radiotherapy. 
Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX 324) 
For the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low 
probability of surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour 
intravenous infusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered as a 30-minute to 
3-hour infusion, followed by 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion from day 1 
142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to day 4. This regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. Following chemotherapy, 
patients should receive chemoradiotherapy. 
For cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose modifications, see the corresponding summary of product 
characteristics. 
Dose adjustments during treatment 
General 
Docetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3. 
In patients who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3 for more than 
one week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel 
therapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 and/or from 75 to 
60 mg/m². If the patient continues to experience these reactions at 60 mg/m², the treatment should be 
discontinued. 
Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer 
Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive docetaxel, doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide (TAC) adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Patients who experience febrile 
neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection should have their docetaxel dose reduced to 60 mg/m² in all 
subsequent cycles (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis should 
have their dose decreased to 60 mg/m². 
In combination with cisplatin 
For patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose 
nadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is < 25,000 cells/mm3, or in patients who 
experience febrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-haematologic toxicities, the docetaxel 
dose in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg/m2. For cisplatin dose adjustments, see the 
corresponding summary of product characteristics.  
In combination with capecitabine 
•  For capecitabine dose modifications, see capecitabine summary of product characteristics. 
•  For patients developing the first appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, which persists at the time of the 
next docetaxel/capecitabine treatment, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, and resume at 
100% of the original dose. 
•  For patients developing the second appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, or the first appearance of 
Grade 3 toxicity, at any time during the treatment cycle, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 
0-1 and then resume treatment with docetaxel 55 mg/m². 
•  For any subsequent appearances of toxicities, or any Grade 4 toxicities, discontinue the docetaxel 
dose. 
For trastuzumab dose modifications, see trastuzumab summary of product characteristics. 
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil 
If an episode of febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection occurs despite 
G-CSF use, the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. If subsequent episodes of 
complicated neutropenia occur the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 60 to 45 mg/m2. In case of 
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. Patients should 
not be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until neutrophils recover to a level 
>1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level >100,000 cells/mm3. Discontinue treatment if these 
toxicities persist (see section 4.4).

In the pivotal SCCHN studies patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged 
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide 
prophylactic coverage (eg, day 6-15) in all subsequent cycles. 
Special populations 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Based on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/m² as single agent, patients who have both 
elevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal 
range (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of 
docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin > ULN and/or 
ALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase > 6 times the ULN, no 
dose-reduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. 
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric 
adenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 × ULN 
associated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 × ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no 
dose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No 
data are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other 
indications.  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of DOCETAXEL KABI in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged 
1 month to less than 18 years have not yet been established. 
There is no relevant use of DOCETAXEL KABI in the paediatric population in the indications breast 
cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma and head and neck cancer, not 
including type II and III less differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 
Elderly 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in the elderly. 
In combination with capecitabine, for patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of 
capecitabine to 75% is recommended (see capecitabine summary of product characteristics). 
Method of administration 
For instructions on preparation and administration of the product, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
144 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with baseline neutrophil count of < 1,500 cells/mm3. 
Patients with severe liver impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Contraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
For breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as 
dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel 
administration, unless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well 
as the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral 
dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2). 
Haematology 
Neutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median 
of 7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of 
complete blood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be 
retreated with docetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). 
In the case of severe neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of 
docetaxel therapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate 
symptomatic measures are recommended (see section 4.2). 
In patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile 
neutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic 
G-CSF. Patients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of 
complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). 
Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
In patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), 
febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received 
primary G-CSF prophylaxis. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive 
adjuvant therapy with TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile 
neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TAC should be 
closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Gastrointestinal reactions 
Caution is recommended for patients with neutropenia, particularly at risk for developing 
gastrointestinal complications. Although majority of cases occurred during the first or second cycle of 
docetaxel containing regimen, enterocolitis could develop at any time, and could lead to death as early 
as on the first day of onset. Patients should be closely monitored for early manifestations of serious 
gastrointestinal toxicity (see sections 4.2, 4.4 Haematology, and 4.8). 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and 
second infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation 
of the infusion of docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should 
be available. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised 
cutaneous reactions do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe 
hypotension, bronchospasm or generalised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of 
docetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions 
should not be re-challenged with docetaxel. Patients who have previously experienced a 
hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel may be at risk to develop hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel, 
145 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
including more severe hypersensitivity reaction. These patients should be closely monitored during 
initiation of docetaxel therapy. 
Cutaneous reactions 
Localised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema 
followed by desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by 
desquamation which lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see 
section 4.2). 
Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic 
Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) have been 
reported with docetaxel treatment. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of 
serious skin manifestations and closely monitored. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions 
appear discontinuation of docetaxel should be considered. 
Fluid retention 
Patients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be 
monitored closely. 
Respiratory disorders 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, 
pulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure have been reported and may be associated with fatal 
outcome. Cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant 
radiotherapy. 
If new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop, patients should be closely monitored, promptly 
investigated, and appropriately treated. Interruption of docetaxel therapy is recommended until 
diagnosis is available. Early use of supportive care measures may help improve the condition. The 
benefit of resuming docetaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated. 
Patients with liver impairment 
In patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels 
(ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels 
greater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as 
toxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, 
infections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel 
in those patients with elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m2 and LFTs should be measured at 
baseline and before each cycle (see section 4.2). 
For patients with serum bilirubin levels > ULN and/or ALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN concurrent 
with serum alkaline phosphatase levels > 6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended 
and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. 
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric 
adenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 × ULN 
associated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 × ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no 
dose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No 
data are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other 
indications.  
Patients with renal impairment 
There are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel. 
146 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nervous system 
The development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2). 
Cardiac toxicity 
Heart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, 
particularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may 
be moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8). 
When patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they 
should undergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during 
treatment (e.g. every three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For 
more details see summary of product characteristics of trastuzumab.  
Ventricular arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia (sometimes fatal) has been reported in 
patients treated with docetaxel in combination regimens including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and/ or 
cyclophosphamide (see section 4.8).  
Baseline cardiac assessment is recommended.   
Eye disorders 
Cystoid macular oedema (CMO) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with 
impaired vision should undergo a prompt and complete ophthalmologic examination. In case CMO is 
diagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated (see section 
4.8). 
Second primary malignancies 
Second primary malignancies have been reported when docetaxel was given in combination with 
anticancer treatments known to be associated with second primary malignancies.  Second primary 
malignancies (including acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma) may occur several months or years after docetaxel-containing therapy. Patients should be 
monitored for second primary malignancies (see section 4.8). 
Tumour Lysis Syndrome 
Tumour lysis syndrome has been reported with docetaxel after the first or the second cycle (see section 
4.8). Patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome (e.g. with renal impairment, hyperuricemia, bulky 
tumour, rapid progression) should be closely monitored. Correction of dehydration and treatment of 
high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of treatment. 
Others 
Women of childbearing potential must use contraceptive measures during treatment and for 2 months 
after cessation of treatment with docetaxel. Men must use contraceptive measures during treatment 
and for 4 months after cessation of treatment with docetaxel (see section 4.6). 
The concomitant use of docetaxel with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and 
voriconazole) should be avoided (see section 4.5). 
Additional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer 
Complicated neutropenia 
For patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or 
infection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). 
147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gastrointestinal reactions 
Symptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, 
may be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated 
promptly. 
Congestive heart failure (CHF) 
Patients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the 
follow up period. In patients treated with the TAC regimen for node positive breast cancer, the risk of 
CHF has been shown to be higher during the first year after treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Patients with 4+ nodes 
As the benefit observed in patient with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on disease-free 
survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with 4+ 
nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis (see section 5.1). 
Elderly  
Cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer 
There are limited data available in patients > 70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with 
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. 
Cautions for use in castration-resistant prostate cancer 
Of the 333 patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks in a prostate cancer study (TAX 327), 
209 patients were 65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients 
treated with docetaxel every three weeks, the incidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate 
≥ 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients. The 
incidence of related fever, diarrhoea, anorexia, and peripheral oedema occurred at rates ≥ 10% higher 
in patients who were 75 years of age or greater versus less than 65 years. 
Cautions for use in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
Of the 545 patients treated with docetaxel every 3 weeks in a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer study 
(STAMPEDE), 296 patients were 65 years of age or older, and 48 patients were 75 years of age or 
older. More patients aged ≥65 years in the docetaxel arm reported hypersensitivity reaction, 
neutropenia, anaemia, fluid retention, dyspnea, and nail changes when compared to the patients aged 
less than 65 years. None of these increases in frequency reached 10% difference with the control arm. 
In patients who were 75 years of age or older, when compared to younger patients, neutropenia, 
anaemia, diarrhea, dyspnea and upper respiratory tract infection were reported with a greater incidence 
(at least 10% higher).  
Cautions for use in gastric adenocarcinoma cancer 
Among the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) 
patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer 
study, 74 were 65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of 
serious adverse events was higher in older people compared to younger patients. The incidence of the 
following adverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection occurred at rates 
≥ 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients. 
Elderly treated with TCF should be closely monitored. 
Excipients 
This medicine contains 3.16 g of alcohol (ethanol) in each 8 ml which is equivalent to 39.5% w/v. The 
amount in 9 ml of dose is equivalent to 88.9 ml of beer and 35.6 ml of wine. 
Harmful for those suffering from alcoholism. 
To be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women, children and high-risk groups 
such as patients with liver disease, or epilepsy. 
148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Because this medicine is usually given slowly over 1 hours, the effects of alcohol may be reduced. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may alter the effects of other medicinal products. 
Co-administration with medicines containing e.g.propylene glycol or ethanol may lead to 
accumulation of ethanol and induce adverse effects, in particular in young children with low or 
immature metabolic capacity. 
In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant 
administration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the 
enzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as ciclosporine, ketoconazole and erythromycin. As 
a result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with these medicinal products as 
concomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction. 
In case of combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors, the occurrence of docetaxel adverse reactions may 
increase, as a result of reduced metabolism. If the concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin and voriconazole) cannot be avoided, a close clinical surveillance is warranted and a 
dose-adjustment of docetaxel may be suitable during the treatment with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor 
(see section 4.4). In a pharmacokinetic study with 7 patients, the co-administration of docetaxel with 
the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole leads to a significant decrease in docetaxel clearance by 
49%. 
Docetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic 
prostate cancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4. 
No statistically significant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. 
Docetaxel is highly protein bound (> 95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with 
concomitantly administered medicinal product has not been investigated formally, in vitro interactions 
with tightly protein-bound agents such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, propafenone, 
phenytoin, salicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein binding of 
docetaxel. In addition, dexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. Docetaxel did not 
influence the binding of digitoxin. 
The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their 
co-administration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction 
between docetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was 
about 50% higher than values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/ Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential and men receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming 
pregnant, and not to father a child and to inform the treating physician immediately should this occur.  
Due to the genotoxic risk of docetaxel (see section 5.3), women of childbearing potential must use 
effective method of contraception during treatment and for 2 months after cessation of treatment with 
docetaxel. Men must use effective method of contraception during treatment and for 4 months after 
cessation of treatment with docetaxel. 
Pregnancy 
149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be 
both embryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats. As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, 
docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Therefore, docetaxel must 
not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated.  
Breast-feeding 
Docetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. 
Consequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be 
discontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy. 
Fertility 
Studies in animals have shown that, docetaxel  may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). Therefore, 
males being treated with docetaxel must seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. The amount of 
alcohol in this medicinal product and the side effects of the product may impair the ability to drive or 
use machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Therefore, patients should be warned of the potential impact 
of the amount of alcohol and the side effects of this medicinal product on the ability to drive or use 
machines, and be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience these side effects during 
treatment. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile for all indications 
The adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel 
have been obtained in:

1,276 patients (744 and 532 in TAX 316 and GEICAM 9805 respectively) who received 
docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (clinically important 
treatment related adverse events are presented). 
300 gastric adenocarcinoma patients (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 
79 patients in the phase II part) who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and

cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). 
545 patients (STAMPEDE study) who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or 
prednisolone and ADT. 
These reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; 
grade 3-4 = G3/4; grade 4 = G4), the COSTART and the MedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined as: 
150 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available 
data). 
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was 
reversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe 
neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea 
and asthenia. The severity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in 
combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. 
For combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in ≥ 10% are displayed. There 
was an increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the 
trastuzumab combination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. 
For combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects (≥ 5%) 
reported in a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see 
capecitabine summary of product characteristics). 
For combination with ADT and with prednisone or prednisolone (STAMPEDE study), adverse events 
occurring over the 6 cycles of treatment with docetaxel and having at least 2% higher incidence in the 
docetaxel treatment arm by comparison to the control arm, are presented, using the CTCAE grading 
scale. 
The following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel:  
Immune system disorders 
Hypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the 
infusion of docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms 
were flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills. 
Severe reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized 
rash/erythema (see section 4.4). 
Nervous system disorders 
The development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4). Mild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paraesthesia, dysesthesia or pain 
including burning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Reversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to 
moderate. Reactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and 
hands (including severe hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently 
associated with pruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. 
Less frequently, severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to 
interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe 
nail disorders are characterised by hypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyper pigmentation, inflammation, 
redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis or extravasation and swelling of the vein.  
Fluid retention includes events such as peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, 
pericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain. The peripheral oedema usually starts at the lower 
extremities and may become generalised with a weight gain of 3 kg or more. Fluid retention is 
cumulative in incidence and severity (see section 4.4).

Description of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for DOCETAXEL KABI 100 mg/m² single 
agent 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Rare: bleeding episodes associated with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia.  
Nervous system disorders 
Reversibility data are available among 35.3% of patients who developed neurotoxicity following 
docetaxel treatment at 100 mg/m² as single agent. The events were spontaneously reversible within 
3 months. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Very rare: one case of alopecia non-reversible at the end of the study. 73% of the cutaneous reactions 
were reversible within 21 days. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation was more than 1,000 mg/m2 and the median 
time to fluid retention reversibility was 16.4 weeks (range 0 to 42 weeks). The onset of moderate and 
severe retention is delayed (median cumulative dose: 818.9 mg/m2) in patients with premedication 
compared with patients without premedication (median cumulative dose: 489.7 mg/m2); however, it 
has been reported in some patients during the early courses of therapy.

Description of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for DOCETAXEL KABI 100 mg/m² in 
combination with trastuzumab 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Very common: Haematological toxicity was increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and 
docetaxel, compared with docetaxel alone (32% grade 3/4 neutropenia versus 22%, using NCI-CTC 
criteria). Note that this is likely to be an underestimate since docetaxel alone at a dose of 100 mg/m2 is 
known to result in neutropenia in 97% of patients, 76% grade 4, based on nadir blood counts. The 
incidence of febrile neutropenia/neutropenic sepsis was also increased in patients treated with 
Herceptin plus docetaxel (23% versus 17% for patients treated with docetaxel alone). 
Cardiac disorders 
Symptomatic cardiac failure was reported in 2.2% of the patients who received docetaxel plus 
trastuzumab compared to 0% of patients given docetaxel alone. In the docetaxel plus trastuzumab arm, 
64% had received a prior anthracycline as adjuvant therapy compared with 55% in the docetaxel arm 
alone.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There were a few reports of overdose. There is no known antidote for docetaxel overdose. In case of 
overdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and vital functions closely monitored. In 
cases of overdose, exacerbation of adverse events may be expected. The primary anticipated 
complications of overdose would consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity and 
mucositis. Patients should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose. 
Other appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken, as needed.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, plant alkaloids and other natural products, taxanes, 
ATC Code: L01CD02  
Mechanism of action 
Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable 
microtubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The 
binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. 
Docetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for 
vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and 
against freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular 
concentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some 
but not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance 
168 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental anti-tumour 
activity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Breast cancer 
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide: adjuvant therapy 
Patients with operable node-positive breast cancer (TAX 316) 
Data from a multi-centre open-label randomised study support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant 
treatment of patients with operable node-positive breast cancer and KPS ≥ 80%, between 18 and 
70 years of age. After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 
4+), 1491 patients were randomised to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after 
doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 
followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FAC arm). Both regimens 
were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, 
all other medicinal products were given as intravenous bolus on day one. G-CSF was administered as 
secondary prophylaxis to patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, 
prolonged neutropenia, or infection). Patients on the TAC arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with 
ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. In 
both arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with positive oestrogen and/or progesterone 
receptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed 
according to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 69% of patients who 
received TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC. Two interim analyses and one final analysis 
were performed. The first interim analysis was planned 3 years after the date when half of study 
enrolment was done. The second interim analysis was done after 400 DFS events had been recorded 
overall, which led to a median follow-up of 55 months. The final analysis was performed when all 
patients had reached their 10-year follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow 
up before). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) 
was the secondary efficacy endpoint. 
A final analysis was performed with an actual median follow up of 96 months. Significantly longer 
disease-free survival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. Incidence of 
relapses at 10 years was reduced in patients receiving TAC compared to those who received FAC 
(39% versus 45%, respectively) i.e. an absolute risk reduction by 6% (p = 0.0043). Overall survival at 
10 years was also significantly increased with TAC compared to FAC (76% versus 69%, respectively) 
i.e. an absolute reduction of the risk of death by 7% (p = 0.002). As the benefit observed in patients 
with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on DFS and OS, the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC 
in patients with 4+ nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis. 
Overall, the study results demonstrate a positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC.

Patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy (GEICAM 9805) 
Data from a multi-centre open-label randomisedtrial support the use of DOCETAXEL KABI for the 
adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive 
chemotherapy. 1060 patients were randomised to receive either DOCETAXEL KABI 75 mg/m2 
administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (539 patients in 
TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 
500 mg/m2 (521 patients in FAC arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable node-negative breast cancer 
patients with high risk of relapse according to 1998 St. Gallen criteria (tumour size > 2 cm and/or 
negative ER and PR and/or high histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and /or age < 35 years).). 
Both regimens were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. DOCETAXEL KABI was 
administered as a 1-hour infusion, all other medicinal products were given intraveinously on day 1 
every three weeks. Primary prophylactic G-CSF was made mandatory in TAC arm after 230 patients 
were randomised. The incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection 
was decreased in patients who received primary G-CSF prophylaxis (see section 4.8). In both arms, 
after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ tumours received tamoxifen 
20 mg once a day for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was administered according to 
guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 57.3% of patients who received TAC 
and 51.2% of patients who received FAC. 
One primary analysis and one updated analysis were performed. The primary analysis was done when 
all patients had a follow-up of greater than 5 years (median follow-up time of 77 months). The updated 
analysis was performed when all patients had reached their 10-year (median follow up time of 10 
years and 5 months) follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow-up 
previously). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) 
was the secondary efficacy endpoint. 
Athe median follow-up time of 77 months, significantly longer disease-free survival for the TAC arm 
compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in the risk of 
relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), p = 0.01). At the 
median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 16,5% reduction in the 
risk of relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% CI (0.65-1.08), 
p=0.1646). DFS data were not statistically significant but were still associated with a positive trend in 
favour of TAC.   
At the median follow-up time of 77 months, overall survival (OS) was longer in the TAC arm with 
TAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk of death compared to FAC (hazard ratio = 
0.76, 95% CI (0.46-1.26, p = 0.29). However, the distribution of OS was not significantly different 
between the 2 groups. 
At the median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 9% reduction in 
the risk of death compared to FAC-treated patients (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% CI (0.63-1.32)).  
The survival rate was 93.7% in the TAC arm and 91.4 % in the FAC arm, at the 8-year follow-up time 
point, and 91.3 % in the TAC arm and 89 % in the FAC arm, at the 10-year follow-up time point.

The positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC remained unchanged.

DOCETAXEL KABI as single agent 
Two randomised phase III comparative studies, involving a total of 326 alkylating or 
392 anthracycline failure metastatic breast cancer patients, have been performed with docetaxel at the 
recommended dose and regimen of 100 mg/m² every 3 weeks. 
In alkylating-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to doxorubicin (75 mg/m² every 3 weeks). 
Without affecting overall survival time (docetaxel 15 months vs. doxorubicin 14 months, p = 0.38) or 
time to progression (docetaxel 27 weeks vs. doxorubicin 23 weeks, p = 0.54), docetaxel increased 
response rate (52% vs. 37%, p = 0.01) and shortened time to response (12 weeks vs. 23 weeks, 
p= 0.007). Three docetaxel patients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas 
15 doxorubicin patients (9%) discontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart 
failure). 
In anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and 
vinblastine (12 mg/m² every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m² every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate 
(33% vs. 12%, p < 0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p= 0.0004) and 
prolonged overall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p= 0.01). 
During these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety profile 
observed in phase II studies (see section 4.8). 
An open-label, multi-centre, randomised phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel 
monotherapy and paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous 
therapy should have included an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomised to receive 
either docetaxel monotherapy 100 mg/m² as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m² as a 3 hour 
infusion. Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks. 
Without affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p = 0.10), docetaxel 
prolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p < 0.01) and median survival 
(15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p = 0.03). 
More grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to 
paclitaxel (23.0%). 
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with doxorubicin 
One large randomised phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic 
disease, has been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/m²) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m²) 
(AT arm) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/m²) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m²) (AC 
arm). Both regimens were administered on day 1 every 3 weeks.  
•  Time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.0138. 
The median TTP was 37.3 weeks (95% CI: 33.4 - 42.1) in AT arm and 31.9 weeks (95% CI: 27.4 - 
36.0) in AC arm.  
•  Overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.009. 
The ORR was 59.3% (95% CI: 52.8 - 65.9) in AT arm versus 46.5% (95% CI: 39.8 - 53.2) in AC 
arm.  
In this study, AT arm showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile 
neutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), infection (8% versus 2.4%), diarrhoea (7.5% versus 1.4%), asthenia 
(8.5% versus 2.4%), and pain (2.8% versus 0%) than AC arm. On the other hand, AC arm showed a 
higher incidence of severe anaemia (15.8% versus 8.5%) than AT arm, and, in addition, a higher 
incidence of severe cardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF 
decrease ≥ 20% (13.1% versus 6.1%), absolute LVEF decrease ≥ 30% (6.2% versus 1.1%). Toxic 
deaths occurred in 1 patient in the AT arm (congestive heart failure) and in 4 patients in the AC arm 
(1 due to septic shock and 3 due to congestive heart failure).

Docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab was studied for the treatment of patients with metastatic 
breast cancer whose tumours overexpress HER2, and who previously had not received chemotherapy 
for metastatic disease. One hundred eighty six patients were randomised to receive docetaxel 
(100 mg/m2) with or without trastuzumab; 60% of patients received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant 
chemotherapy. Docetaxel plus trastuzumab was efficacious in patients whether or not they had 
received prior adjuvant anthracyclines. The main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in 
this pivotal study was immunohistochemistry (IHC). A minority of patients were tested using 
fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). In this study, 87% of patients had disease that was IHC 3+, 
and 95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC 3+ and/or FISH positive. Efficacy results are 
summarized in the following table:

DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with capecitabine 
Data from one multi-centre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical study support the use of 
docetaxel in combination with capecitabine for treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy, including an anthracycline. In this 
study, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous 
infusion every 3 weeks) and capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week 
rest period). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/m2 as a 1 hour 
intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine 
combination arm (p = 0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 352 days 
(docetaxel alone). The overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator 
assessment) were 41.6% (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to 
progressive disease was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine combination arm (p < 0.0001). The 
median time to progression was 186 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
Patients previously treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy 
In a phase III study, in previously treated patients, time to progression (12.3 weeks versus 7 weeks) 
and overall survival were significantly longer for docetaxel at 75 mg/m² compared to Best Supportive 
Care. The 1-year survival rate was also significantly longer in docetaxel (40%) versus BSC (16%). 
There was less use of morphinic analgesic (p < 0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p < 0.01), other 
173 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disease-related medicinal products (p = 0.06) and radiotherapy (p < 0.01) in patients treated with 
docetaxel at 75 mg/m² compared to those with BSC.  
The overall response rate was 6.8% in the evaluable patients, and the median duration of response was 
26.1 weeks.  
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with platinum agents in chemotherapy-naïve patients 
In a phase III study, 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or 
greater, and who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either 
docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/m2 over 
30-60 minutes every 3 weeks (TCis), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with 
carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/ml.min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/m2 
administered over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on 
day 1 of cycles repeated every 4 weeks (VCis).

Prostate cancer 
Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone in patients with 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were evaluated in a randomised multi-centre phase III 
study (TAX 327). A total of 1006 patients with KPS ≥ 60 were randomised to the following treatment 
groups:  
•  Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. 
•  Docetaxel 30 mg/m2 administered weekly for the first 5 weeks in a 6 week cycle for 5 cycles. 
•  Mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. 
All 3 regimens were administered in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily, 
continuously.

Given the fact that docetaxel every week presented a slightly better safety profile than docetaxel every 
3 weeks, it is possible that certain patients may benefit from docetaxel every week.  
No statistical differences were observed between treatment groups for Global Quality of Life. 
Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
STAMPEDE study 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel administered concomitantly with standard of care (ADT) in 
patients with high-risk locally advanced or metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer were 
evaluated in a randomised multi-centre, multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) study with a seamless phase 
II/III design (STAMPEDE – MRC PR08). A total of 1776 male patients were allocated to the 
treatment arms of interest:  
•  Standard of care + docetaxel 75 mg/m², administered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles 
•  Standard of care alone  
Docetaxel regimen was administered in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily 
continuously.  
Among the 1776 randomised patients 1086 (61%) had metastatic disease, 362 were randomised to 
docetaxel in combination with standard of care, 724 received standard of care alone.  
In these metastatic prostate cancer patients, the median overall survival was significantly longer in 
docetaxel treatment groups than in the standard of care alone group, with a median overall survival 19 
175 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
months longer with the addition of docetaxel to standard of care (HR =  0.76, 95% CI = 0.62-0.92, 
p=0.005).  
Efficacy results in metastatic prostate cancer patients for docetaxel arm versus control arm are

CHAARTED study 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel administered at the beginning of androgen-deprivation therapy 
(ADT) in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer were evaluated in a randomised 
Phase III multi-centre study (CHAARTED). A total of 790 male patients were allocated to the 2 
treatment groups.  
•  ADT + docetaxel 75 mg/m² given at the beginning of ADT, administered every 3 weeks 
for 6 cycles 
•  ADT alone   
The median overall survival was significantly longer in docetaxel treatment group than in the ADT 
alone group, with a median overall survival 13.6 months longer with the addition of docetaxel to ADT 
(hazard ratio (HR) = 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.47-0.80, p=0.0003).

Gastric adenocarcinoma 
A multi-centre, open-label, randomised study, was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
docetaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including 
adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who had not received prior chemotherapy for 
metastatic disease. A total of 445 patients with KPS > 70 were treated with either docetaxel (T) 
177 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(75 mg/m2 on day 1) in combination with cisplatin (C) (75 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (F) 
(750 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) or cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 per 
day for 5 days). The length of a treatment cycle was 3 weeks for the TCF arm and 4 weeks for the CF 
arm. The median number of cycles administered per patient was 6 (with a range of 1-16) for the TCF 
arm compared to 4 (with a range of 1-12) for the CF arm. Time to progression (TTP) was the primary 
endpoint. The risk reduction of progression was 32.1% and was associated with a significantly longer 
TTP (p = 0.0004) in favour of the TCF arm. Overall survival was also significantly longer 
(p = 0.0201) in favour of the TCF arm with a risk reduction of mortality of 22.7%. Efficacy results are

Subgroup analyses across age, gender and race consistently favoured the TCF arm compared to the CF 
arm.  
A survival update analysis conducted with a median follow-up time of 41.6 months no longer showed 
a statistically significant difference although always in favour of the TCF regimen and showed that the 
benefit of TCF over CF is clearly observed between 18 and 30 months of follow up.  
Overall, quality of life (QoL) and clinical benefit results consistently indicated improvement in favour 
of the TCF arm. Patients treated with TCF had a longer time to 5% definitive deterioration of global 
health status on the QLQ-C30 questionnaire (p = 0.0121) and a longer time to definitive worsening of 
Karnofsky performance status (p = 0.0088) compared to patients treated with CF. 
Head and neck cancer 
Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX323)  
• 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a phase III, multi-centre, open-label, 
randomised study (TAX323). In this study, 358 patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN, 
and WHO performance status 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two treatment arms. Patients on the 
docetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin (P) 75 mg/m2 followed by 
5-fluorouracil (F) 750 mg/m2 per day as a continuous infusion for 5 days. This regimen was 
administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at least a minor response (≥ 25% reduction in 
178 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with 
a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not 
progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (TPF/RT). 
Patients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m2 followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) 
1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days. This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case 
at least a minor response (≥ 25% reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed 
after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval 
of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to 
institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (PF/RT). Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either 
with a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy - 2.0 Gy once a day, 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to 
70 Gy), or accelerated/hyperfractionated regimens of radiation therapy (twice a day, with a minimum 
interfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week). A total of 70 Gy was recommended for accelerated 
regimens and 74 Gy for hyperfractionated schemes. Surgical resection was allowed following 
chemotherapy, before or after radiotherapy. Patients on the TPF arm received antibiotic prophylaxis 
with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. 
The primary endpoint in this study, progression-free survival (PFS), was significantly longer in the 
TPF arm compared to the PF arm, p = 0.0042 (median PFS: 11.4 vs. 8.3 months respectively) with an 
overall median follow up time of 33.7 months. Median overall survival was also significantly longer in 
favour of the TPF arm compared to the PF arm (median OS: 18.6 vs. 14.5 months respectively) with a 
28% risk reduction of mortality, p = 0.0128. Efficacy results are presented in the table below:

Quality of life parameters 
Patients treated with TPF experienced significantly less deterioration of their Global health score 
compared to those treated with PF (p = 0.01, using the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale). 
Clinical benefit parameters 
The performance status scale, for head and neck (PSS-HN) subscales designed to measure 
understandability of speech, ability to eat in public, and normalcy of diet, was significantly in favour 
of TPF as compared to PF. 
Median time to first deterioration of WHO performance status was significantly longer in the TPF arm 
compared to PF. Pain intensity score improved during treatment in both groups indicating adequate 
pain management.  
Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX324)  
• 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a randomised, multi-centre 
open-label, phase III, study (TAX324). In this study, 501 patients, with locally advanced SCCHN, and 
a WHO performance status of 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two arms. The study population 
comprised patients with technically unresectable disease, patients with low probability of surgical cure 
and patients aiming at organ preservation. The efficacy and safety evaluation solely addressed survival 
endpoints and the success of organ preservation was not formally addressed. Patients on the docetaxel 
arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m² by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) 
100 mg/m² administered as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the continuous 
intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m²/day from day 1 to day 4. The cycles were 
repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to receive 
chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per protocol (TPF/CRT). Patients on the comparator arm received 
cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m² as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by the 
continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m²/day from day 1 to day 5. The cycles 
were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to 
receive CRT as per protocol (PF/CRT).  
Patients in both treatment arms were to receive 7 weeks of CRT following induction chemotherapy 
with a minimum interval of 3 weeks and no later than 8 weeks after start of the last cycle (day 22 to 
day 56 of last cycle). During radiotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 1.5) was given weekly as a one-hour 
intravenous infusion for a maximum of 7 doses. Radiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment 
using once daily fractionation (2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks, for a total dose of 
70-72 Gy). Surgery on the primary site of disease and/or neck could be considered at anytime 
following completion of CRT. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the study received 
prophylactic antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study, overall survival (OS) was 
significantly longer (log-rank test, p = 0.0058) with the docetaxel-containing regimen compared to PF 
(median OS: 70.6 versus 30.1 months respectively), with a 30% risk reduction in mortality compared 
to PF (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.90) with an overall median 
follow up time of 41.9 months. The secondary endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a 29% risk reduction of 
progression or death and a 22 month improvement in median PFS (35.5 months for TPF and 13.1 for 
PF). This was also statistically significant with an HR of 0.71; 95% CI 0.56-0.90; log-rank test 
p = 0.004. Efficacy results are presented in the table below:

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel have been evaluated in cancer patients after administration of 20-
115 mg/m2 in phase I studies. The kinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent with 
a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model with half lives for the α, β and γ (terminal) phases of 
4 min, 36 min and between 11.1 h and 17.5 h, respectively, when sampled up to 24 hours. An 
additional study assessing the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel at similar doses (75 – 100 mg/m2) in 
patients, but over a longer time interval (over 22 days) found a longer mean terminal elimination 
halflife between 91 and 120 hours. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of 
docetaxel from the peripheral compartment. 
Distribution 
Following the administration of a 100 mg/m2 dose given as a one-hour infusion a mean peak plasma 
level of 3.7 μg/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.6 h.μg/ml. Mean values for total body 
clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter 
individual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% 
bound to plasma proteins. 
Elimination 
A study of 14C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in 
both the urine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl 
181 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ester group, within seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of 
the administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is 
excreted during the first 48 hours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites 
and very low amounts of unchanged medicinal product.  
Special populations 
Age and gender 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from phase I 
studies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient. 
Hepatic impairment 
In a small number of patients (n = 23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver 
function impairment (ALT, AST ≥ 1.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase ≥ 2.5 
times the ULN), total clearance was lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2). 
Fluid retention 
Docetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to moderate fluid retention and there are 
no data available in patients with severe fluid retention. 
Combination therapy 
Doxorubicin 
When used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma 
levels of doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin 
and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their co-administration.  
Capecitabine 
Phase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice versa 
showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no 
effect by docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5'-DFUR.  
Cisplatin 
Clearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed following 
monotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel infusion is 
similar to that observed with cisplatin alone.  
Cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil 
The combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid 
tumours had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product.  
Prednisone and dexamethasone 
The effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard 
dexamethasone premedication has been studied in 42 patients. 
Prednisone 
No effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. 
5.3   Preclinical safety data 
The carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. 
182 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Docetaxel has been shown to be genotoxic by an aneugenic mechanism in the in vitro micronucleus 
and chromosome aberration test in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. 
However, it did not induce mutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. 
These results are consistent with the pharmacological activity of docetaxel.  
Undesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair 
male fertility.

immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate or infusion 
solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately and thoroughly with 
water. 
Preparation for the intravenous administration 
Preparation of the infusion solution 
DO NOT use other docetaxel medicinal products consisting of 2 vials (concentrate and solvent) 
with this medicinal product (DOCETAXEL KABI 160 mg/8 ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion, which contains only 1 vial). 
DOCETAXEL KABI 160 mg/8 ml concentrate for solution for infusion requires NO prior 
dilution with a solvent and is ready to add to the infusion solution. 
Each vial is for single use and should be used immediately. 
If the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required number of boxes of DOCETAXEL KABI 
concentrate for solution for infusion to stand below 25°C for 5 minutes before use. More than one vial 
of DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate for solution for infusion may be necessary to obtain the required 
dose for the patient. Aseptically withdraw the required amount of DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate 
for solution for infusion using a calibrated syringe.  
In DOCETAXEL KABI 160 mg/8 ml vial the concentration of docetaxel is 20 mg/ml. 
The  required  volume  of  DOCETAXEL  KABI  concentrate  for  solution  for infusion  must be  injected 
via  a  single  injection  (one  shot)  into  a  250 ml  infusion  bag  or  bottle  containing  either  5%  glucose 
solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. 
If a dose greater than 190 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so 
that a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. 
Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. 
The infusion bag solution should be used within 6 hours below 25°C including the one hour infusion 
to the patient. 
As with all parenteral products, DOCETAXEL KABI infusion solution should be visually inspected 
prior to use, and solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. 
Docetaxel infusion solution is supersaturated, therefore may crystallize over time. If crystals appear, 
the solution must no longer be used and shall be discarded. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The use of docetaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy and it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the 
use of anticancer chemotherapy (see section 6.6). 
Posolgy 
For breast, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers, premedication consisting of an oral 
corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to 
docetaxel administration, unless contraindicated, can be used (see section 4.4).  
For metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone or 
prednisolone the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours 
and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). 
For metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, irrespective of the concurrent use of prednisone or 
prednisolone, the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg 12 hours, 3 hours, 
and 1 hour before docetaxel infusion (see section 4.4). 
Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. 
Docetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks.  
Breast cancer 
In the adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive and node-negative breast cancer, the recommended 
dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 
500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (TAC regimen) (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). 
For the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose 
187 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 in monotherapy. In first-line treatment, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 is given in 
combination therapy with doxorubicin (50 mg/m2). 
In combination with trastuzumab the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 every three weeks, 
with trastuzumab administered weekly. In the pivotal study the initial docetaxel infusion was started 
the day following the first dose of trastuzumab. The subsequent docetaxel doses were administered 
immediately after completion of the trastuzumab infusion, if the preceding dose of trastuzumab was 
well tolerated. For trastuzumab dose and administration, see trastuzumab summary of product 
characteristics.  
In combination with capecitabine, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every three weeks, 
combined with capecitabine at 1250 mg/m2 twice daily (within 30 minutes after a meal) for 2 weeks 
followed by a 1-week rest period. For capecitabine dose calculation according to body surface area, 
see capecitabine summary of product characteristics.  
Non-small cell lung cancer 
In chemotherapy naïve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen 
is docetaxel 75 mg/m2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment 
after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m² as a single 
agent. 
Prostate cancer 
Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer  
The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2. Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily 
is administered continuously (see section 5.1). 
Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Prednisone or 
prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily may be administered continuously. 
Gastric adenocarcinoma 
The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion, followed by cisplatin 
75 mg/m2, as a 1- to 3- hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m2 per 
day given as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion. 
Treatment is repeated every three weeks. Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and 
appropriate hydration for cisplatin administration. Prophylactic G-CSF should be used to mitigate the 
risk of haematological toxicities (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). 
Head and neck cancer 
Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and appropriate hydration (prior to and after 
cisplatin administration). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological 
toxicities. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the TAX 323 and TAX 324 studies, received 
prophylactic antibiotics. 
• 
• 
Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX 323) 
For the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head 
and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion 
followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a 
continuous infusion at 750 mg/m2 per day for five days. This regimen is administered every 
3 weeks for 4 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should receive radiotherapy. 
Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX 324) 
For the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low 
probability of surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour 
intravenous infusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered as a 30-minute to 
3-hour infusion, followed by 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion from day 1 
188 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to day 4. This regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. Following chemotherapy, 
patients should receive chemoradiotherapy. 
For cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose modifications, see the corresponding summary of product 
characteristics. 
Dose adjustments during treatment 
General 
Docetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3. 
In patients who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3 for more than 
one week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel 
therapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 and/or from 75 to 
60 mg/m². If the patient continues to experience these reactions at 60 mg/m², the treatment should be 
discontinued. 
Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer 
Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive docetaxel, doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide (TAC) adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Patients who experience febrile 
neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection should have their docetaxel dose reduced to 60 mg/m² in all 
subsequent cycles (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis should 
have their dose decreased to 60 mg/m². 
In combination with cisplatin 
For patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose 
nadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is < 25,000 cells/mm3, or in patients who 
experience febrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-haematologic toxicities, the docetaxel 
dose in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg/m2. For cisplatin dose adjustments, see the 
corresponding summary of product characteristics.  
In combination with capecitabine 
•  For capecitabine dose modifications, see capecitabine summary of product characteristics. 
•  For patients developing the first appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, which persists at the time of the 
next docetaxel/capecitabine treatment, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, and resume at 
100% of the original dose. 
•  For patients developing the second appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, or the first appearance of 
Grade 3 toxicity, at any time during the treatment cycle, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 
0-1 and then resume treatment with docetaxel 55 mg/m². 
•  For any subsequent appearances of toxicities, or any Grade 4 toxicities, discontinue the docetaxel 
dose. 
For trastuzumab dose modifications, see trastuzumab summary of product characteristics. 
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil 
If an episode of febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection occurs despite 
G-CSF use, the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. If subsequent episodes of 
complicated neutropenia occur the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 60 to 45 mg/m2. In case of 
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. Patients should 
not be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until neutrophils recover to a level 
>1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level >100,000 cells/mm3. Discontinue treatment if these 
toxicities persist (see section 4.4).

In the pivotal SCCHN studies patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged 
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide 
prophylactic coverage (eg, day 6-15) in all subsequent cycles. 
Special populations 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Based on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/m² as single agent, patients who have both 
elevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal 
range (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of 
docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin > ULN and/or 
ALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase > 6 times the ULN, no 
dose-reduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. 
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric 
adenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 × ULN 
associated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 × ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no 
dose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No 
data are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other 
indications.  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of DOCETAXEL KABI in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged 
1 month to less than 18 years have not yet been established. 
There is no relevant use of DOCETAXEL KABI in the paediatric population in the indications breast 
cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma and head and neck cancer, not 
including type II and III less differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 
Elderly 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in the elderly 
In combination with capecitabine, for patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of 
capecitabine to 75% is recommended (see capecitabine summary of product characteristics). 
Method of administration 
For instructions on preparation and administration of the product, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
190 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with baseline neutrophil count of < 1,500 cells/mm3. 
Patients with severe liver impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Contraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
For breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as 
dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel 
administration, unless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well 
as the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral 
dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2). 
Haematology 
Neutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median 
of 7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of 
complete blood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be 
retreated with docetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). 
In the case of severe neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of 
docetaxel therapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate 
symptomatic measures are recommended (see section 4.2). 
In patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile 
neutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic 
G-CSF. Patients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of 
complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). 
Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
In patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), 
febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received 
primary G-CSF prophylaxis. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive 
adjuvant therapy with TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile 
neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TAC should be 
closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Gastrointestinal reactions 
Caution is recommended for patients with neutropenia, particularly at risk for developing 
gastrointestinal complications. Although majority of cases occurred during the first or second cycle of 
docetaxel containing regimen, enterocolitis could develop at any time, and could lead to death as early 
as on the first day of onset. Patients should be closely monitored for early manifestations of serious 
gastrointestinal toxicity (see sections 4.2, 4.4 Haematology, and 4.8). 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and 
second infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation 
of the infusion of docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should 
be available. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised 
cutaneous reactions do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe 
hypotension, bronchospasm or generalised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of 
docetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions 
should not be re-challenged with docetaxel. Patients who have previously experienced a 
191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel may be at risk to develop hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel, 
including more severe hypersensitivity reaction. These patients should be closely monitored during 
initiation of docetaxel therapy. 
Cutaneous reactions 
Localised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema 
followed by desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by 
desquamation which lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see 
section 4.2). 
Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic 
Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) have been 
reported with docetaxel treatment. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of 
serious skin manifestations and closely monitored. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions 
appear discontinuation of docetaxel should be considered. 
Fluid retention 
Patients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be 
monitored closely. 
Respiratory disorders 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, 
pulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure have been reported and may be associated with fatal 
outcome. Cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant 
radiotherapy. 
If new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop, patients should be closely monitored, promptly 
investigated, and appropriately treated. Interruption of docetaxel therapy is recommended until 
diagnosis is available. Early use of supportive care measures may help improve the condition. The 
benefit of resuming docetaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated. 
Patients with liver impairment 
In patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels 
(ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels 
greater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as 
toxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, 
infections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel 
in those patients with elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m2 and LFTs should be measured at 
baseline and before each cycle (see section 4.2). 
For patients with serum bilirubin levels > ULN and/or ALT and AST > 3.5 times the ULN concurrent 
with serum alkaline phosphatase levels > 6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended 
and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. 
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric 
adenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 × ULN 
associated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 × ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no 
dose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No 
data are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other 
indications.  
Patients with renal impairment 
There are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel. 
192 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nervous system 
The development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2). 
Cardiac toxicity 
Heart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, 
particularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may 
be moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8). 
When patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they 
should undergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during 
treatment (e.g. every three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For 
more details see summary of product characteristics of trastuzumab.  
Ventricular arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia (sometimes fatal) has been reported in 
patients treated with docetaxel in combination regimens including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and/ or 
cyclophosphamide (see section 4.8).  
Baseline cardiac assessment is recommended.   
Eye disorders 
Cystoid macular oedema (CMO) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with 
impaired vision should undergo a prompt and complete ophthalmologic examination. In case CMO is 
diagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated (see section 
4.8). 
Second primary malignancies 
Second primary malignancies have been reported when docetaxel was given in combination with 
anticancer treatments known to be associated with second primary malignancies.  Second primary 
malignancies (including acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma) may occur several months or years after docetaxel-containing therapy. Patients should be 
monitored for second primary malignancies (see section 4.8). 
Tumour Lysis Syndrome 
Tumour lysis syndrome has been reported with docetaxel after the first or the second cycle (see section 
4.8). Patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome (e.g. with renal impairment, hyperuricemia, bulky 
tumour, rapid progression) should be closely monitored. Correction of dehydration and treatment of 
high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of treatment. 
Others 
Women of childbearing potential must use contraceptive measures during treatment and for 2 months 
after cessation of treatment with docetaxel. Men must use contraceptive measures during treatment 
and for 4 months after cessation of treatment with docetaxel (see section 4.6). 
The concomitant use of docetaxel with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and 
voriconazole) should be avoided (see section 4.5). 
Additional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer 
Complicated neutropenia 
For patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or 
infection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). 
Gastrointestinal reactions 
193 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Symptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, 
may be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated 
promptly. 
Congestive heart failure (CHF) 
Patients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the 
follow up period. In patients treated with the TAC regimen for node positive breast cancer, the risk of 
CHF has been shown to be higher during the first year after treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Patients with 4+ nodes 
As the benefit observed in patient with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on disease-free 
survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with 4+ 
nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis (see section 5.1). 
Elderly  
Cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer 
There are limited data available in patients > 70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with 
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. 
Cautions for use in castration-resistant prostate cancer 
Of the 333 patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks in a prostate cancer study (TAX 327), 
209 patients were 65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients 
treated with docetaxel every three weeks, the incidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate 
≥ 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients. The 
incidence of related fever, diarrhoea, anorexia, and peripheral oedema occurred at rates ≥ 10% higher 
in patients who were 75 years of age or greater versus less than 65 years. 
Cautions for use in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
Of the 545 patients treated with docetaxel every 3 weeks in a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer study 
(STAMPEDE), 296 patients were 65 years of age or older, and 48 patients were 75 years of age or 
older. More patients aged ≥65 years in the docetaxel arm reported hypersensitivity reaction, 
neutropenia, anaemia, fluid retention, dyspnea, and nail changes when compared to the patients aged 
less than 65 years. None of these increases in frequency reached 10% difference with the control arm. 
In patients who were 75 years of age or older, when compared to younger patients, neutropenia, 
anaemia, diarrhea, dyspnea and upper respiratory tract infection were reported with a greater incidence 
(at least 10% higher).  
Cautions for use in gastric adenocarcinoma cancer 
Among the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) 
patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer 
study, 74 were 65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of 
serious adverse events was higher in older people compared to younger patients. The incidence of the 
following adverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection occurred at rates 
≥ 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients. 
Elderly treated with TCF should be closely monitored. 
Excipients 
This medicine contains 3.55 g of alcohol (ethanol) in each 9 ml which is equivalent to 39.5% w/v. The 
amount in 9 ml of dose is equivalent to 88.9 ml of beer and 35.6 ml of wine. 
Harmful for those suffering from alcoholism. 
To be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women, children and high-risk groups 
such as patients with liver disease, or epilepsy. 
Because this medicine is usually given slowly over 1 hours, the effects of alcohol may be reduced. 
194 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may alter the effects of other medicinal products. 
Co-administration with medicines containing e.g.propylene glycol or ethanol may lead to 
accumulation of ethanol and induce adverse effects, in particular in young children with low or 
immature metabolic capacity. 
In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant 
administration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the 
enzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as ciclosporine,  ketoconazole and erythromycin. 
As a result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with these medicinal products as 
concomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction. 
In case of combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors, the occurrence of docetaxel adverse reactions may 
increase, as a result of reduced metabolism. If the concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin and voriconazole) cannot be avoided, a close clinical surveillance is warranted and a 
dose-adjustment of docetaxel may be suitable during the treatment with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor 
(see section 4.4). In a pharmacokinetic study with 7 patients, the co-administration of docetaxel with 
the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole leads to a significant decrease in docetaxel clearance by 
49%. 
Docetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic 
prostate cancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4. 
No statistically significant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. 
Docetaxel is highly protein bound (> 95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with 
concomitantly administered medicinal product has not been investigated formally, in vitro interactions 
with tightly protein-bound agents such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, propafenone, 
phenytoin, salicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein binding of 
docetaxel. In addition, dexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. Docetaxel did not 
influence the binding of digitoxin. 
The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their 
co-administration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction 
between docetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was 
about 50% higher than values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/ Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential and men receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming 
pregnant, and not to father a child and to inform the treating physician immediately should this occur.  
Due to the genotoxic risk of docetaxel (see section 5.3), women of childbearing potential must use 
effective method of contraception during treatment and for 2 months after cessation of treatment with 
docetaxel. Men must use effective method of contraception during treatment and for 4 months after 
cessation of treatment with docetaxel. 
Pregnancy 
195 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be 
both embryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats. As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, 
docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Therefore, docetaxel must 
not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated.  
Breast-feeding 
Docetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. 
Consequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be 
discontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy. 
Fertility 
Studies in animals have shown that  docetaxel may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). Therefore, 
males being treated with docetaxel must seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. The amount of 
alcohol in this medicinal product and the side effects of the product may impair the ability to drive or 
use machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Therefore, patients should be warned of the potential impact 
of the amount of alcohol and the side effects of this medicinal product on the ability to drive or use 
machines, and be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience these side effects during 
treatment. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile for all indications 
The adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel 
have been obtained in:

prednisolone and ADT. 
These reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; 
grade 3-4 = G3/4; grade 4 = G4), the COSTART and the MedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined as: 
196 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available 
data). 
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was 
reversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe 
neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea 
and asthenia. The severity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in 
combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. 
For combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in ≥ 10% are displayed. There 
was an increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the 
trastuzumab combination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. 
For combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects (≥ 5%) 
reported in a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see 
capecitabine summary of product characteristics). 
For combination with ADT and with prednisone or prednisolone (STAMPEDE study), adverse events 
occurring over the 6 cycles of treatment with docetaxel and having at least 2% higher incidence in the 
docetaxel treatment arm by comparison to the control arm, are presented, using the CTCAE grading 
scale. 
The following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel:  
Immune system disorders 
Hypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the 
infusion of docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms 
were flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills. 
Severe reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized 
rash/erythema (see section 4.4). 
Nervous system disorders 
The development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4). Mild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paraesthesia, dysesthesia or pain 
including burning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Reversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to 
moderate. Reactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and 
hands (including severe hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently 
associated with pruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. 
Less frequently, severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to 
interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe 
nail disorders are characterised by hypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyper pigmentation, inflammation, 
redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis or extravasation and swelling of the vein.  
Fluid retention includes events such as peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, 
pericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain. The peripheral oedema usually starts at the lower 
197 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
extremities and may become generalised with a weight gain of 3 kg or more. Fluid retention is 
cumulative in incidence and severity (see section 4.4).

Description of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for DOCETAXEL KABI 100 mg/m² single 
agent 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Rare: bleeding episodes associated with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia.  
Nervous system disorders 
Reversibility data are available among 35.3% of patients who developed neurotoxicity following 
docetaxel treatment at 100 mg/m² as single agent. The events were spontaneously reversible within 
3 months. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Very rare: one case of alopecia non-reversible at the end of the study. 73% of the cutaneous reactions 
were reversible within 21 days. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation was more than 1,000 mg/m2 and the median 
time to fluid retention reversibility was 16.4 weeks (range 0 to 42 weeks). The onset of moderate and 
severe retention is delayed (median cumulative dose: 818.9 mg/m2) in patients with premedication 
compared with patients without premedication (median cumulative dose: 489.7 mg/m2); however, it 
has been reported in some patients during the early courses of therapy.

Description of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for DOCETAXEL KABI 100 mg/m² in 
combination with trastuzumab 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Very common: Haematological toxicity was increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and 
docetaxel, compared with docetaxel alone (32% grade 3/4 neutropenia versus 22%, using NCI-CTC 
criteria). Note that this is likely to be an underestimate since docetaxel alone at a dose of 100 mg/m2 is 
known to result in neutropenia in 97% of patients, 76% grade 4, based on nadir blood counts. The 
incidence of febrile neutropenia/neutropenic sepsis was also increased in patients treated with 
Herceptin plus docetaxel (23% versus 17% for patients treated with docetaxel alone). 
Cardiac disorders 
Symptomatic cardiac failure was reported in 2.2% of the patients who received docetaxel plus 
trastuzumab compared to 0% of patients given docetaxel alone. In the docetaxel plus trastuzumab arm, 
64% had received a prior anthracycline as adjuvant therapy compared with 55% in the docetaxel arm 
alone.

be ongoing in 29 TAC patients (3.9%) and 16 FAC patients (2,2%). 
In GEICAM 9805 study alopecia that started during the treatment period and persisted into the follow-
up period was observed to be ongoing in 49 patients (9.2 %) in TAC arm and 35 patients (6.7 %) in 
FAC  arm.  Alopecia  related  to  study  drug  started  or  worsened  during  the  follow-up  period  in 
42 patients  (7.9 %)  in  TAC  arm  and  30  patients  (5.8 %)  in  FAC  arm.  At  the  end  of  the  follow-up 
period (median follow-up time of 10 years and 5 months), alopecia was observed to be ongoing in 3 
patients (0.6%) in TAC arm, and in 1 patient (0.2%) in FAC arm.   
Reproductive system and breast disorders 
In TAX316 amenorrhoea that started during the treatment period and persisted into the follow-up 
period after the end of chemotherapy was reported in 202 of 744 TAC patients (27.2%) and 125 of 736 
FAC patients (17.0%). Amenorrhea was observed to be ongoing at the end of the follow-up period 
(median follow-up time of 8 years) in 121 of 744 TAC patients (16.3%) and 86 FAC patients (11.7%). 
In  GEICAM  9805  study  amenorrhoea  that  started  during  the  treatment  period  and  persisted  into  the 
follow-up period was observed to be ongoing in 18 patients (3.4 %) in TAC arm and 5 patients (1.0 %) 
in FAC arm. At the end of the follow-up period (median follow-up time of 10 years and 5 months), 
amenorrhoea was observed to be ongoing in 7 patients (1.3%) in TAC arm, and in 4 patients (0.8%) in 
FAC arm. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
 In study TAX316 peripheral oedema that started during the treatment period and persisted into the 
follow-up period after the end of chemotherapy was observed in 119 of 744 TAC patients (16.0%) and 
23 of 736 FAC patients (3.1%). At the end of the follow-up period (actual median follow-up time of 8 
years), peripheral oedema was ongoing in19 TAC patients (2.6%) and 4 FAC patients (0.5%).  
In study TAX316 lymphoedema that started during the treatment period and persisted into the follow-
up period after the end of chemotherapy was reported in 11 of 744 TAC patients (1.5%) and 1 of 736 
FAC patients (0.1%). At the end of the follow-up period (actual median follow-up time of 8 years), 
lymphoedema was observed to be ongoing in 6 TAC patients (0.8%) and 1 FAC patient (0.1%). 
In study TAX316 asthenia that started during the treatment period and persisted into the follow-up 
period after the end of chemotherapy was reported in 236 of 744 TAC patients (31.7%) and 180 of 736 
FAC patients (24.5%). At the end of the follow-up period (actual median follow-up time of 8 years), 
asthenia was observed to be ongoing in 29 TAC patients (3.9%) and 16 FAC patients (2.2%). 
In study GEICAM 9805 peripheral oedema that started during the treatment period persisted into the 
follow-up period in 4 patients (0.8%) in TAC arm and in 2 patients (0.4%) in FAC arm. At the end of 
the follow-up period (median follow-up time of 10 years and 5 months), no patients (0%) in TAC arm 
had peripheral oedema and it was observed to be ongoing in 1 patient (0.2%) in FAC arm. 
Lymphoedema that started during the treatment period persisted into the follow-up period in 5 patients 
(0.9%) in TAC arm and 2 patients (0.4 %) in FAC arm. At the end of the follow-up period, 
lymphoedema was observed to be ongoing in 4 patients (0.8%) in TAC arm, and in 1 patient (0.2%) in 
FAC arm.  
Asthenia that started during the treatment period and persisted into the follow-up period was observed 
to be ongoing in 12 patients (2.3 %) in TAC arm and 4 patients (0.8 %) in FAC arm. At the end of the 
follow-up period, asthenia was observed to be ongoing in 2 patients (0.4%) in TAC arm, and in 2 
patients (0.4%) in FAC arm. 
Acute leukaemia / Myelodysplastic syndrome 
After 10 years of follow up in study TAX316, acute leukaemia was reported in 3 of 744 TAC patients 
(0.4%) and in 1 of 736 FAC patients (0.1%). One TAC patient (0.1%) and 1 FAC patient (0.1%) died 
due to AML during the follow-up period (median follow-up time of 8 years). Myelodysplastic 
syndrome was reported in 2 of 744 TAC patients (0.3%) and in 1 of 736 FAC patients (0.1%).

Musculoskeletal disorder 
Myositis has been reported with docetaxel (frequency not known). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There were a few reports of overdose. There is no known antidote for docetaxel overdose. In case of 
overdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and vital functions closely monitored. In 
cases of overdose, exacerbation of adverse events may be expected. The primary anticipated 
complications of overdose would consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity and 
mucositis. Patients should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose. 
Other appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken, as needed.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, plant alkaloids and other natural products, taxanes, 
ATC Code: L01CD02  
Mechanism of action 
Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable 
microtubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The 
binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. 
Docetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for 
vital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Docetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and 
against freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular 
concentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some 
but not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance 
214 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental anti-tumour 
activity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Breast cancer 
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide: adjuvant therapy 
Patients with operable node-positive breast cancer (TAX 316) 
Data from a multi-centre open-label randomised study support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant 
treatment of patients with operable node-positive breast cancer and KPS ≥ 80%, between 18 and 
70 years of age. After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 
4+), 1491 patients were randomised to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after 
doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 
followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclosphosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FAC arm). Both regimens 
were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, 
all other medicinal products were given as intravenous bolus on day one. G-CSF was administered as 
secondary prophylaxis to patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, 
prolonged neutropenia, or infection). Patients on the TAC arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with 
ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. In 
both arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with positive oestrogen and/or progesterone 
receptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed 
according to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 69% of patients who 
received TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC. Two interim analyses and one final analysis 
were performed. The first interim analysis was planned 3 years after the date when half of study 
enrolment was done. The second interim analysis was done after 400 DFS events had been recorded 
overall, which led to a median follow-up of 55 months. The final analysis was performed when all 
patients had reached their 10-year follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow 
up before). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) 
was the secondary efficacy endpoint. 
A final analysis was performed with an actual median follow up of 96 months. Significantly longer 
disease-free survival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. Incidence of 
relapses at 10 years was reduced in patients receiving TAC compared to those who received FAC 
(39% versus 45%, respectively) i.e. an absolute risk reduction by 6% (p = 0.0043). Overall survival at 
10 years was also significantly increased with TAC compared to FAC (76% versus 69%, respectively) 
i.e. an absolute reduction of the risk of death by 7% (p = 0.002). As the benefit observed in patients 
with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on DFS and OS, the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC 
in patients with 4+ nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis. 
Overall, the study results demonstrate a positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC.

Patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy (GEICAM 9805) 
Data from a multi-centre open-label randomised trial support the use of DOCETAXEL KABI for the 
adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive 
chemotherapy. 1060 patients were randomised to receive either DOCETAXEL KABI 75 mg/m2 
administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (539 patients in 
TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclosphosphamide 
500 mg/m2 (521 patients in FAC arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable node-negative breast cancer 
patients with high risk of relapse according to 1998 St. Gallen criteria (tumour size > 2 cm and/or 
negative ER and PR and/or high histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and /or age < 35 years).). 
Both regimens were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. DOCETAXEL KABI was 
administered as a 1-hour infusion, all other medicinal product were given intraveinously on day 1 
every three weeks. Primary prophylactic G-CSF was made mandatory in TAC arm after 230 patients 
were randomised. The incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection 
was decreased in patients who received primary G-CSF prophylaxis (see section 4.8). In both arms, 
after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with ER+ and/or PgR+ tumours received tamoxifen 
20 mg once a day for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was administered according to 
guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 57.3% of patients who received TAC 
and 51.2% of patients who received FAC. 
One primary analysis and one updated analysis were performed. The primary analysis was done when 
all patients had a follow-up of greater than 5 years (median follow-up time of 77 months). The updated 
analysis was performed when all patients had reached their 10-year (median follow up time of 10 
years and 5 months) follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow-up 
previously). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) 
was the secondary efficacy endpoint. 
At the median follow-up time of 77 months, significantly longer disease-free survival for the TAC arm 
compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in the risk of 
relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), p = 0.01). At the 
median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 16,5% reduction in the 
risk of relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% CI (0.65-1.08), 
p=0.1646). DFS data were not statistically significant but were still associated with a positive trend in 
favour of TAC.   
At the median follow-up time of 77 months overall survival (OS) was also longer in the TAC arm with 
TAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk of death compared to FAC (hazard ratio = 
0.76, 95% CI (0.46-1.26, p = 0.29). However, the distribution of OS was not significantly different 
between the 2 groups. 
At the median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 9% reduction in 
the risk of death compared to FAC-treated patients (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% CI (0.63-1.32)).  
The survival rate was 93.7% in the TAC arm and 91.4 % in the FAC arm, at the 8-year follow-up time 
point, and 91.3 % in the TAC arm and 89 % in the FAC arm, at the 10-year follow-up time point.

The positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC remained unchanged.

DOCETAXEL KABI as single agent 
Two randomised phase III comparative studies, involving a total of 326 alkylating or 
392 anthracycline failure metastatic breast cancer patients, have been performed with docetaxel at the 
recommended dose and regimen of 100 mg/m² every 3 weeks. 
In alkylating-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to doxorubicin (75 mg/m² every 3 weeks). 
Without affecting overall survival time (docetaxel 15 months vs. doxorubicin 14 months, p = 0.38) or 
time to progression (docetaxel 27 weeks vs. doxorubicin 23 weeks, p = 0.54), docetaxel increased 
response rate (52% vs. 37%, p = 0.01) and shortened time to response (12 weeks vs. 23 weeks, 
p= 0.007). Three docetaxel patients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas 
15 doxorubicin patients (9%) discontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart 
failure). 
In anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and 
vinblastine (12 mg/m² every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m² every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate 
(33% vs. 12%, p < 0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p= 0.0004) and 
prolonged overall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p= 0.01). 
During these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety profile 
observed in phase II studies (see section 4.8). 
An open-label, multi-centre, randomised phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel 
monotherapy and paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous 
therapy should have included an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomised to receive 
either docetaxel monotherapy 100 mg/m² as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m² as a 3 hour 
infusion. Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks. 
Without affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p = 0.10), docetaxel 
prolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p < 0.01) and median survival 
(15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p = 0.03). 
More grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to 
paclitaxel (23.0%). 
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with doxorubicin 
One large randomised phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic 
disease, has been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/m²) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m²) 
(AT arm) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/m²) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m²) (AC 
arm). Both regimens were administered on day 1 every 3 weeks.  
•  Time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.0138. 
The median TTP was 37.3 weeks (95% CI: 33.4 - 42.1) in AT arm and 31.9 weeks (95% CI: 27.4 - 
36.0) in AC arm.  
•  Overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the AT arm versus AC arm, p = 0.009. 
The ORR was 59.3% (95% CI: 52.8 - 65.9) in AT arm versus 46.5% (95% CI: 39.8 - 53.2) in AC 
arm.  
In this study, AT arm showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile 
neutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), infection (8% versus 2.4%), diarrhoea (7.5% versus 1.4%), asthenia 
(8.5% versus 2.4%), and pain (2.8% versus 0%) than AC arm. On the other hand, AC arm showed a 
higher incidence of severe anaemia (15.8% versus 8.5%) than AT arm, and, in addition, a higher 
incidence of severe cardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF 
decrease ≥ 20% (13.1% versus 6.1%), absolute LVEF decrease ≥ 30% (6.2% versus 1.1%). Toxic 
deaths occurred in 1 patient in the AT arm (congestive heart failure) and in 4 patients in the AC arm 
(1 due to septic shock and 3 due to congestive heart failure).  
218 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In both arms, quality of life measured by the EORTC questionnaire was comparable and stable during 
treatment and follow-up.  
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with trastuzumab 
Docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab was studied for the treatment of patients with metastatic 
breast cancer whose tumours overexpress HER2, and who previously had not received chemotherapy 
for metastatic disease. One hundred eighty six patients were randomised to receive docetaxel 
(100 mg/m2) with or without trastuzumab; 60% of patients received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant 
chemotherapy. Docetaxel plus trastuzumab was efficacious in patients whether or not they had 
received prior adjuvant anthracyclines. The main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in 
this pivotal study was immunohistochemistry (IHC). A minority of patients were tested using 
fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). In this study, 87% of patients had disease that was IHC 3+, 
and 95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC 3+ and/or FISH positive. Efficacy results are 
summarized in the following table:

DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with capecitabine 
Data from onemulti-centre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical study support the use of 
docetaxel in combination with capecitabine for treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy, including an anthracycline. In this 
study, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous 
infusion every 3 weeks) and capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week 
rest period). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/m2 as a 1 hour 
intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine 
combination arm (p = 0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 352 days 
(docetaxel alone). The overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator 
assessment) were 41.6% (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to 
progressive disease was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine combination arm (p < 0.0001). The 
median time to progression was 186 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
Patients previously treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy 
In a phase III study, in previously treated patients, time to progression (12.3 weeks versus 7 weeks) 
and overall survival were significantly longer for docetaxel at 75 mg/m² compared to Best Supportive 
Care. The 1-year survival rate was also significantly longer in docetaxel (40%) versus BSC (16%). 
There was less use of morphinic analgesic (p < 0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p < 0.01), other 
219 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disease-related medicinal products (p = 0.06) and radiotherapy (p < 0.01) in patients treated with 
docetaxel at 75 mg/m² compared to those with BSC.  
The overall response rate was 6.8% in the evaluable patients, and the median duration of response was 
26.1 weeks.  
DOCETAXEL KABI in combination with platinum agents in chemotherapy-naïve patients 
In a phase III study, 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or 
greater, and who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either 
docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/m2 over 
30-60 minutes every 3 weeks (TCis), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with 
carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/ml.min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/m2 
administered over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on 
day 1 of cycles repeated every 4 weeks (VCis).

For docetaxel/carboplatin combination, neither equivalent nor non-inferior efficacy could be proven 
compared to the reference treatment combination VCis.  
Prostate cancer 
Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone in patients with 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were evaluated in a randomised multi-centrephase III 
study (TAX 327). A total of 1006 patients with KPS ≥ 60 were randomised to the following treatment 
groups:  
•  Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. 
•  Docetaxel 30 mg/m2 administered weekly for the first 5 weeks in a 6 week cycle for 5 cycles. 
•  Mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. 
All 3 regimens were administered in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily, 
continuously. 
Patients who received docetaxel every three weeks demonstrated significantly longer overall survival 
compared to those treated with mitoxantrone. The increase in survival seen in the docetaxel weekly

Given the fact that docetaxel every week presented a slightly better safety profile than docetaxel every 
3 weeks, it is possible that certain patients may benefit from docetaxel every week.  
No statistical differences were observed between treatment groups for Global Quality of Life. 
Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
STAMPEDE study 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel administered concomitantly with standard of care (ADT) in 
patients with high-risk locally advanced or metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer were 
evaluated in a randomised multi-centre, multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) study with a seamless phase 
II/III design (STAMPEDE – MRC PR08). A total of 1776 male patients were allocated to the 
treatment arms of interest:  
•  Standard of care + docetaxel 75 mg/m², administered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles 
•  Standard of care alone  
Docetaxel regimen was administered in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily 
continuously.  
Among the 1776 randomised patients 1086 (61%) had metastatic disease, 362 were randomised to 
docetaxel in combination with standard of care, 724 received standard of care alone.  
In these metastatic prostate cancer patients, the median overall survival was significantly longer in 
docetaxel treatment groups than in the standard of care alone group, with a median overall survival 19 
months longer with the addition of docetaxel to standard of care (HR =  0.76, 95% CI = 0.62-0.92, 
p=0.005).

CHAARTED study 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel administered at the beginning of androgen-deprivation therapy 
(ADT) in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer were evaluated in a randomised 
Phase III multi-centre study (CHAARTED). A total of 790 male patients were allocated to the 2 
treatment groups.  
•  ADT + docetaxel 75 mg/m² given at the beginning of ADT, administered every 3 weeks 
for 6 cycles 
•  ADT alone   
The median overall survival was significantly longer in docetaxel treatment group than in the ADT 
alone group, with a median overall survival 13.6 months longer with the addition of docetaxel to ADT 
(hazard ratio (HR) = 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.47-0.80, p=0.0003).

Gastric adenocarcinoma 
A multi-centre, open-label, randomised study, was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
docetaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including 
adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who had not received prior chemotherapy for 
metastatic disease. A total of 445 patients with KPS > 70 were treated with either docetaxel (T) 
223 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(75 mg/m2 on day 1) in combination with cisplatin (C) (75 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (F) 
(750 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) or cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 per 
day for 5 days). The length of a treatment cycle was 3 weeks for the TCF arm and 4 weeks for the CF 
arm. The median number of cycles administered per patient was 6 (with a range of 1-16) for the TCF 
arm compared to 4 (with a range of 1-12) for the CF arm. Time to progression (TTP) was the primary 
endpoint. The risk reduction of progression was 32.1% and was associated with a significantly longer 
TTP (p = 0.0004) in favour of the TCF arm. Overall survival was also significantly longer 
(p = 0.0201) in favour of the TCF arm with a risk reduction of mortality of 22.7%. Efficacy results are

Subgroup analyses across age, gender and race consistently favoured the TCF arm compared to the 
CF arm.  
A survival update analysis conducted with a median follow-up time of 41.6 months no longer showed 
a statistically significant difference although always in favour of the TCF regimen and showed that the 
benefit of TCF over CF is clearly observed between 18 and 30 months of follow up.  
Overall, quality of life (QoL) and clinical benefit results consistently indicated improvement in favour 
of the TCF arm. Patients treated with TCF had a longer time to 5% definitive deterioration of global 
health status on the QLQ-C30 questionnaire (p = 0.0121) and a longer time to definitive worsening of 
Karnofsky performance status (p = 0.0088) compared to patients treated with CF. 
Head and neck cancer 
Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX323)  
• 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a phase III, multi-centre, open-label, 
randomised study (TAX323). In this study, 358 patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN, 
and WHO performance status 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two treatment arms. Patients on the 
docetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin (P) 75 mg/m2 followed by 
5-fluorouracil (F) 750 mg/m2 per day as a continuous infusion for 5 days. This regimen was 
administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at least a minor response (≥ 25% reduction in 
224 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with 
a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not 
progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (TPF/RT). 
Patients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m2 followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) 
1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days. This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case 
at least a minor response (≥ 25% reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed 
after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval 
of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to 
institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (PF/RT). Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either 
with a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy - 2.0 Gy once a day, 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to 
70 Gy), or accelerated/hyperfractionated regimens of radiation therapy (twice a day, with a minimum 
interfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week). A total of 70 Gy was recommended for accelerated 
regimens and 74 Gy for hyperfractionated schemes. Surgical resection was allowed following 
chemotherapy, before or after radiotherapy. Patients on the TPF arm received antibiotic prophylaxis 
with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. 
The primary endpoint in this study, progression-free survival (PFS), was significantly longer in the 
TPF arm compared to the PF arm, p = 0.0042 (median PFS: 11.4 vs. 8.3 months respectively) with an 
overall median follow up time of 33.7 months. Median overall survival was also significantly longer in 
favour of the TPF arm compared to the PF arm (median OS: 18.6 vs. 14.5 months respectively) with a 
28% risk reduction of mortality, p = 0.0128. Efficacy results are presented in the table below:

Quality of life parameters 
Patients treated with TPF experienced significantly less deterioration of their Global health score 
compared to those treated with PF (p = 0.01, using the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale). 
Clinical benefit parameters 
The performance status scale, for head and neck (PSS-HN) subscales designed to measure 
understandability of speech, ability to eat in public, and normalcy of diet, was significantly in favour 
of TPF as compared to PF. 
Median time to first deterioration of WHO performance status was significantly longer in the TPF arm 
compared to PF. Pain intensity score improved during treatment in both groups indicating adequate 
pain management.  
Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX324)  
• 
The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a randomised, multi-
centre open-label, phase III, study (TAX324). In this study, 501 patients, with locally advanced 
SCCHN, and a WHO performance status of 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two arms. The study 
population comprised patients with technically unresectable disease, patients with low probability of 
surgical cure and patients aiming at organ preservation. The efficacy and safety evaluation solely 
addressed survival endpoints and the success of organ preservation was not formally addressed. 
Patients on the docetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m² by intravenous infusion on day 1 
followed by cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m² administered as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion, 
followed by the continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m²/day from day 1 to 
day 4. The cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive 
disease were to receive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per protocol (TPF/CRT). Patients on the 
comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m² as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion on 
day 1 followed by the continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m²/day from day 
1 to day 5. The cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have 
progressive disease were to receive CRT as per protocol (PF/CRT).  
Patients in both treatment arms were to receive 7 weeks of CRT following induction chemotherapy 
with a minimum interval of 3 weeks and no later than 8 weeks after start of the last cycle (day 22 to 
day 56 of last cycle). During radiotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 1.5) was given weekly as a one-hour 
intravenous infusion for a maximum of 7 doses. Radiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment 
using once daily fractionation (2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks, for a total dose of 
70-72 Gy). Surgery on the primary site of disease and/or neck could be considered at anytime 
following completion of CRT. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the study received 
prophylactic antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study, overall survival (OS) was 
significantly longer (log-rank test, p = 0.0058) with the docetaxel-containing regimen compared to PF 
(median OS: 70.6 versus 30.1 months respectively), with a 30% risk reduction in mortality compared 
to PF (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.90) with an overall median 
follow up time of 41.9 months. The secondary endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a 29% risk reduction of 
progression or death and a 22 month improvement in median PFS (35.5 months for TPF and 13.1 for 
PF). This was also statistically significant with an HR of 0.71; 95% CI 0.56-0.90; log-rank test 
p = 0.004. Efficacy results are presented in the table below:

Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel have been evaluated in cancer patients after administration of 20-
115 mg/m2 in phase I studies. The kinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent with 
a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model with half lives for the α, β and γ (terminal) phases of 
4 min, 36 min and 11.1 h and 17.5 h, respectively when sampled up to 24 hours. An additional study 
assessing the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel at similar doses (75 – 100 mg/m2) in patients, but over a 
longer time interval (over 22 days) found a longer mean terminal elimination halflife between 91 and 
120 hours. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel from the peripheral 
compartment. 
Distribution 
Following the administration of a 100 mg/m2 dose given as a one-hour infusion a mean peak plasma 
level of 3.7 μg/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.6 h.μg/ml. Mean values for total body 
clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter 
individual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% 
bound to plasma proteins. 
Elimination 
A study of 14C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in 
both the urine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl 
227 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ester group, within seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of 
the administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is 
excreted during the first 48 hours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites 
and very low amounts of unchanged medicinal product.  
Special populations 
Age and gender 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from phase I 
studies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient. 
Hepatic impairment 
In a small number of patients (n = 23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver 
function impairment (ALT, AST ≥ 1.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase ≥ 2.5 
times the ULN), total clearance was lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2). 
Fluid retention 
Docetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to moderate fluid retention and there are 
no data available in patients with severe fluid retention. 
Combination therapy 
Doxorubicin 
When used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma 
levels of doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin 
and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their co-administration.  
Capecitabine 
Phase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice versa 
showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no 
effect by docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5'-DFUR.  
Cisplatin 
Clearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed following 
monotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel infusion is 
similar to that observed with cisplatin alone.  
Cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil 
The combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid 
tumours had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product.  
Prednisone and dexamethasone 
The effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard 
dexamethasone premedication has been studied in 42 patients. 
Prednisone 
No effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. 
5.3   Preclinical safety data 
The carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. 
Docetaxel has been shown to be genotoxic by an aneugenic mechanism in the in vitro micronucleus 
and chromosome aberration test in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. 
228 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, it did not induce mutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. 
These results are consistent with the pharmacological activity of docetaxel.  
Undesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair 
male fertility.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
DOCETAXEL KABI is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, 
caution should be exercised when handling it and preparing the solution. The use of gloves is 
recommended. 
If DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, wash 
immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate or infusion 
solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately and thoroughly with 
water. 
Preparation for the intravenous administration 
Preparation of the infusion solution 
DO NOT use other docetaxel medicinal products consisting of 2 vials (concentrate and solvent) 
with this medicinal product (DOCETAXEL KABI 180 mg/9 ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion, which contains only 1 vial). 
DOCETAXEL KABI 180 mg/9 ml concentrate for solution for infusion requires NO prior 
dilution with a solvent and is ready to add to the infusion solution. 
Each vial is for single use and should be used immediately. 
If the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required number of boxes of DOCETAXEL KABI 
concentrate for solution for infusion to stand below 25°C for 5 minutes before use. More than one vial 
of DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate for solution for infusion may be necessary to obtain the required 
dose for the patient. Aseptically withdraw the required amount of DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate 
for solution for infusion using a calibrated syringe.  
In DOCETAXEL KABI 180 mg/9 ml vial the concentration of docetaxel is 20 mg/ml. 
The  required  volume  of  DOCETAXEL  KABI  concentrate  for  solution  for infusion  must be  injected 
via  a  single  injection  (one  shot)  into  a  250 ml  infusion  bag  or  bottle  containing  either  5%  glucose 
solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. 
If a dose greater than 190 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so 
that a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. 
Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. 
The infusion bag solution should be used within 6 hours below 25°C including the one hour infusion 
to the patient. 
As with all parenteral products, DOCETAXEL KABI infusion solution should be visually inspected 
prior to use, and solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. 
Docetaxel infusion solution is supersaturated, therefore may crystallize over time. If crystals appear, 
the solution must no longer be used and shall be discarded. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
PREPARATION GUIDE FOR USE WITH DOCETAXEL KABI 20 mg/1 ml CONCENTRATE 
FOR SOLUTION FOR INFUSION  
It is important that you read the entire contents of this guide prior to the preparation of the 
DOCETAXEL KABI infusion solution. 
Recommendations for the safe handling 
Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be 
exercised when handling it and preparing its solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. 
If DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, wash 
immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If it should come into contact with mucous 
membranes, wash immediately and thoroughly with water. 
Preparation of the intravenous administration 
Preparation of the infusion solution 
DO NOT use other docetaxel medicine consisting of 2 vials (concentrate and solvent) with this 
medicine (DOCETAXEL KABI 20 mg/1 ml concentrate for solution for infusion, which contains 
only 1 vial). 
DOCETAXEL KABI 20 mg/1 ml concentrate for solution for infusion requires NO prior 
dilution with a solvent and is ready to add to the infusion solution. 
•  Each vial is for single use and should be used immediately after opening. If not used immediately, 
in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. More than one vial of 
concentrate for solution for infusion may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the patient. 
For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would require 7 ml docetaxel concentrate for solution. 
•  Aseptically withdraw the required amount of concentrate for solution for infusion with a calibrated 
syringe. 
In DOCETAXEL KABI 20 mg/1 ml vial the concentration of docetaxel is 20 mg/ml. 
•  Then, inject via a single injection (one shot) into a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle containing either 
5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. If a dose greater 
than 190 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so that a 
concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. 
•  Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. 
•  From a microbiological point of view, reconstitution /dilution must take place in controlled and 
aseptic conditions and the infusion solution should be used immediately. If not used immediately, 
in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. 
Once added as recommended into the infusion bag, the docetaxel infusion solution, if stored below 
25°C, is stable for 6 hours. It should be used within 6 hours (including the one hour infusion 
intravenous administration). 
Docetaxel infusion solution is supersaturated, therefore may crystallize over time. If crystals 
appear, the solution must no longer be used and shall be discarded. 
•  As with all parenteral products, infusion solution should be visually inspected prior to use, 
solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. 
Disposal 
All materials that have been utilised for dilution and administration should be disposed of according to 
standard procedures. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater. Ask your pharmacist how to 
throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.

PREPARATION GUIDE FOR USE WITH DOCETAXEL KABI 80 mg/4 ml CONCENTRATE 
FOR SOLUTION FOR INFUSION  
It is important that you read the entire contents of this guide prior to the preparation of the 
DOCETAXEL KABI infusion solution. 
Recommendations for the safe handling 
Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be 
exercised when handling it and preparing its solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. 
If DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, wash 
immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If it should come into contact with mucous 
membranes, wash immediately and thoroughly with water. 
Preparation of the intravenous administration 
Preparation of the infusion solution 
DO NOT use other docetaxel medicine consisting of 2 vials (concentrate and solvent) with this 
medicine (DOCETAXEL KABI 80 mg/4 ml concentrate for solution for infusion, which contains 
only 1 vial). 
DOCETAXEL KABI 80 mg/4 ml concentrate for solution for infusion requires NO prior 
dilution with a solvent and is ready to add to the infusion solution. 
•  Each vial is for single use and should be used immediately after opening. If not used immediately, 
in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. More than one vial of 
concentrate for solution for infusion may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the patient. 
For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would require 7 ml docetaxel concentrate for solution. 
•  Aseptically withdraw the required amount of concentrate for solution for infusion with a calibrated 
syringe. 
In DOCETAXEL KABI 80 mg/4 ml vial the concentration of docetaxel is 20 mg/ml. 
•  Then, inject via a single injection (one shot) into a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle containing either 
5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. If a dose greater 
than 190 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so that a 
concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. 
•  Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. 
•  From a microbiological point of view, reconstitution /dilution must take place in controlled and 
aseptic conditions and the infusion solution should be used immediately. If not used immediately, 
in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. 
Once added as recommended into the infusion bag, the docetaxel infusion solution, if stored below 
25°C, is stable for 6 hours. It should be used within 6 hours (including the one hour infusion 
intravenous administration). 
Docetaxel infusion solution is supersaturated, therefore may crystallize over time. If crystals 
appear, the solution must no longer be used and shall be discarded. 
•  As with all parenteral products, infusion solution should be visually inspected prior to use, 
solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. 
Disposal 
All materials that have been utilised for dilution and administration should be disposed of according to 
standard procedures. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater. Ask your pharmacist how to 
throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.

PREPARATION GUIDE FOR USE WITH DOCETAXEL KABI 120 mg/6 ml 
CONCENTRATE FOR SOLUTION FOR INFUSION  
It is important that you read the entire contents of this guide prior to the preparation of the 
DOCETAXEL KABI infusion solution. 
Recommendations for the safe handling 
Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be 
exercised when handling it and preparing its solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. 
If DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, wash 
immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If it should come into contact with mucous 
membranes, wash immediately and thoroughly with water. 
Preparation of the intravenous administration 
Preparation of the infusion solution 
DO NOT use other docetaxel medicine consisting of 2 vials (concentrate and solvent) with this 
medicine (DOCETAXEL KABI 120 mg/6 ml concentrate for solution for infusion, which 
contains only 1 vial). 
DOCETAXEL KABI 120 mg/6 ml concentrate for solution for infusion requires NO prior 
dilution with a solvent and is ready to add to the infusion solution. 
•  Each vial is for single use and should be used immediately after opening. If not used immediately, 
in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. More than one vial of 
concentrate for solution for infusion may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the patient. 
For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would require 7 ml docetaxel concentrate for solution. 
•  Aseptically withdraw the required amount of concentrate for solution for infusion with a calibrated 
syringe. 
In DOCETAXEL KABI 120 mg/6 ml vial the concentration of docetaxel is 20 mg/ml. 
•  Then, inject via a single injection (one shot) into a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle containing either 
5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. If a dose greater 
than 190 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so that a 
concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. 
•  Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. 
•  From a microbiological point of view, reconstitution /dilution must take place in controlled and 
aseptic conditions and the infusion solution should be used immediately. If not used immediately, 
in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. 
Once added as recommended into the infusion bag, the docetaxel infusion solution, if stored below 
25°C, is stable for 6 hours. It should be used within 6 hours (including the one hour infusion 
intravenous administration). 
Docetaxel infusion solution is supersaturated, therefore may crystallize over time. If crystals 
appear, the solution must no longer be used and shall be discarded. 
•  As with all parenteral products, infusion solution should be visually inspected prior to use, 
solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. 
Disposal 
All materials that have been utilised for dilution and administration should be disposed of according to 
standard procedures. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater. Ask your pharmacist how to 
throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.

It is important that you read the entire contents of this guide prior to the preparation of the 
DOCETAXEL KABI infusion solution. 
Recommendations for the safe handling 
Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be 
exercised when handling it and preparing its solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. 
If DOCETAXEL KABI concentrate or infusion solution should come into contact with skin, wash 
immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If it should come into contact with mucous 
membranes, wash immediately and thoroughly with water. 
Preparation of the intravenous administration 
Preparation of the infusion solution 
DO NOT use other docetaxel medicine consisting of 2 vials (concentrate and solvent) with this 
medicine (DOCETAXEL KABI 180 mg/9 ml concentrate for solution for infusion, which 
contains only 1 vial). 
DOCETAXEL KABI 180 mg/9 ml concentrate for solution for infusion requires NO prior 
dilution with a solvent and is ready to add to the infusion solution. 
•  Each vial is for single use and should be used immediately after opening. If not used immediately, 
in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. More than one vial of 
concentrate for solution for infusion may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the patient. 
For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would require 7 ml docetaxel concentrate for solution. 
•  Aseptically withdraw the required amount of concentrate for solution for infusion with a calibrated 
syringe. 
In DOCETAXEL KABI 180 mg/9 ml vial the concentration of docetaxel is 20 mg/ml. 
•  Then, inject via a single injection (one shot) into a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle containing either 
5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. If a dose greater 
than 190 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so that a 
concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. 
•  Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. 
•  From a microbiological point of view, reconstitution /dilution must take place in controlled and 
aseptic conditions and the infusion solution should be used immediately. If not used immediately, 
in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. 
Once added as recommended into the infusion bag, the docetaxel infusion solution, if stored below 
25°C, is stable for 6 hours. It should be used within 6 hours (including the one hour infusion 
intravenous administration). 
Docetaxel infusion solution is supersaturated, therefore may crystallize over time. If crystals 
appear, the solution must no longer be used and shall be discarded. 
•  As with all parenteral products, infusion solution should be visually inspected prior to use, 
solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. 
Disposal 
All materials that have been utilised for dilution and administration should be disposed of according to 
standard procedures. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater. Ask your pharmacist how to 
throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.

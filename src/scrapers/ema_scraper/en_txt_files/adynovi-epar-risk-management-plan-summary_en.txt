Summary of risk management plan for [ADYNOVI] ([rurioctocog 
alfa pegol]) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for ADYNOVI. The RMP details important risks of 
ADYNOVI,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about 
ADYNOVI's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
ADYNOVI's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information 
to healthcare professionals and patients on how ADYNOVI should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for ADYNOVI should be read in the context of all this information including 
the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of ADYNOVI's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
ADYNOVI is authorised for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 12 years and above with 
haemophilia  A  (congenital  factor  VIII  deficiency)  (see  SmPC  for  the  full  indication).  It  contains 
rurioctocog alfa pegol as the active substance and after reconstitution, the solution is administered by 
injection via intravenous route. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  ADYNOVI’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  ADYNOVI’s  EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/004195/human_
med_002204.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124%20 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks 
Important risks of ADYNOVI, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about ADYNOVI 's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR  assessment  so  that immediate  action can be  taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of ADYNOVI is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of ADYNOVI are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
 
 
link with the use of ADYNOVI. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that 
is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important Identified Risk: Inhibitor formation 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against 
FVIII is a known complication in the management of 
individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually 
IgG directed against the FVIII procoagulant activity, which 
are quantified in Bethesda units (BU) per mL of plasma 
using the modified Bethesda (Nijmegen) assay. In patients 
who develop inhibitors to FVIII, the condition may manifest 
itself as an insufficient clinical response.  
Risk groups include populations with a medical history of 
FVIII inhibitors, certain gene mutations (e.g., null, large 
deletion), ethnicity, family history, and age at first 
exposure. In addition, there may be an increased risk of 
inhibitor development in PUPs with a positive family history 
of inhibitor development. Studies report a 48% risk of 
inhibitor development in patients with first-degree family 
history, as compared to those without this history risk who 
have a 3x lower risk of development. 
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the age at 
first exposure to FVIII therapy and the extent of exposure 
 
 
 
Important Identified Risk: Inhibitor formation 
to FVIII, the risk being highest within the initial Eds. 
Approximately half of the new inhibitors (49%) presented 
before the patient was 5 years of age. PUPs may have 
undiagnosed high-risk gene mutations which may pre-
dispose the patient to inhibitor formation. 
The incidence of inhibitors initially declines with increasing 
age before rising to a second peak of 10.49 new inhibitors 
per 1000 PY at risk in patients ≥60 years of age. 
Response to treatment may depend on patient-specific 
dosing requirements due to differences of PK parameters. 
Treatment related risk factors for inhibitor development 
include number of EDs (the risk being highest during early 
EDs), intense exposure (risk increased with 5 or more EDs 
at first treatment), and surgery (risk increased if surgery 
combined with intensive first exposure (>4 EDs).

Among patients treated with FVIII concentrates (e.g., 
ADVATE), serious hypersensitivity reactions have been 
occasionally observed in clinical trials. Post-Marketing case 
reports also support the classification.  
Patients with previous history of hypersensitivity and 
allergic reactions to the active substance or any of the 
excipients may be at increased risk. 
Medical history of hypersensitivity and allergic reactions to

Risk factors and risk groups 
High and sustained levels of FVIII activity have been 
statistically associated with arterial or venous thrombosis in 
individuals with underlying risk factors for thrombosis. 
There is a paucity of evidence to support such a risk in the 
context of transiently high levels of FVIII activity, or in the 
target patient population.  
Patients with liver disease, peri- and post-operative 
patients, newborn infants, or other patients at risk for 
thromboembolic events or DIC

PEG- FVIII and IgG/IgM PEG antibodies whereas the 
subject tested negative for IgE antibodies against FVIII and

can neither be confirmed nor excluded.

II.C. Post-authorisation development plan 
II.C.1. Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation 
The following studies are conditions of the marketing authorisation: 
 
PASS TAK-660-403 
Purpose of the study: To evaluate the long-term safety of ADYNOVI/ADYNOVATE prophylaxis in patients 
with haemophilia A when used under standard clinical practice in the real-world setting. 
Primary objective: To assess the long-term safety of prophylaxis with ADYNOVI/ADYNOVATE in patients 
with haemophilia A in the real-world clinical setting through the collection and analysis of adverse events 
(AEs) of special interest (long-term potential effects of PEG accumulation [such as renal, hepatic and 
neurological events], thromboembolic events, hypersensitivity reactions, lack of efficacy and inhibitor 
development), AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). 
Secondary  objective:  To  monitor  the  clinical  effects  of  long-term  exposure  of  prophylaxis  with 
ADYNOVI/ADYNOVATE in patients with haemophilia A, including assessments of kidney and liver function 
parameters, neurological function, and patients’ PEG plasma levels. 
II.C.2. Other studies in post-authorisation development plan 
 
Paediatric PUP study 261203 
 
 
 
 
Purpose  of  the  study:  The  purpose  of  the  study  is  to  investigate  the  safety,  immunogenicity  and 
haemostatic efficacy of PEGylated recombinant FVIII (BAX 855) in PUPs <6 years of age with severe 
haemophilia A (baseline FVIII level < 1%) and < 3 EDs to ADVATE, BAX 855 or FFP. 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  is  to  determine  the  safety  including  immunogenicity  of  BAX 855 
based on the incidence of inhibitor development to FVIII (≥ 0.6 BU/mL using the Nijmegen modification 
of the Bethesda assay). 
The secondary objective is to evaluate efficacy and safety of ITI with BAX855 and to determine the rate 
of success, partial success and failure of ITI with BAX 855

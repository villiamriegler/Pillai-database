Bioackumulering: Klopidogrel har låg potential att bioackumuleras. Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Environmental Risk Classification Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (µg/L) = (A*109*(100-R))/(365*P*V*D*100) = 1.37*10-6*A*(100-R) PEC = 0.415 µg/L Where: A = 3030.845 kg (total sold amount API in Sweden year 2022, data from IQVIA) R = 0% removal rate (due to loss by adsorption to sludge particles, by volatilization, hydrolysis or biodegradation) P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 10*106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (ECHA, 2008; Ref I). D = factor of dilution of waste water by surface water flow = 10 (ECHA, 2008; Ref I). Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) Ecotoxicological studies Algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata): EC50 72 h (biomass) = 4440 μg/L NOEC = 850 μg/L (Protocol: OECD 201) (Ref II) EC50 72 h (growth inhibition) > 6900 μg/L MIC/NOEC = 850 μg/L (Protocol: OECD 201) (Ref II) Crustacean (Daphnia magna): EC50 48 h (immobilization) = 8300 μg/L NOEC 48 h (immobilization) = 6200 μg/L (Protocol: OECD 202) (Ref III) EC50 21 days (growth) > 2300 μg/L NOEC 21 days (growth) = 710 μg/L (Protocol: OECD 211) (Ref IV) Fish (Oncorhynchus mykiss): LC50 96 h (mortality) = 4000 μg/L NOEC 96 h (mortality) = 1010 μg/L (Protocol: OECD 203) (Ref V) Fish (Pimephales promelas): NOEC 21 days (growth & survival) = 310 μg/L (Protocol: OECD 210) (Ref VI) Other ecotoxicity data: PNEC = lowest EC50/10 = 31 µg/L, using results from the most sensitive chronic toxicity endpoint and an assessment factor of 10 (long-term results from at least three species of the base set), to add a safety margin to the toxicity endpoint. The most sensitive species was Pimephales promelas for which the NOEC 21 days was 310 μg/L. Environmental Risk Classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) PEC/PNEC= 0.415/31 = 0.013, i.e. PEC/PNEC ≤ 0.1 which justifies the phrase: “Use of clopidogrel has been considered to result in insignificant environmental risk”. Degradation Biotic degradation Simulation studies: Test results from DT50total system = 7.5 (sediment 1) - 13.5 (sediment 2) days; DT50water = 7.2 (sediment 1) - 8.1 (sediment 2) days. At the end of the study, there was no parent compound remaining in the total system (in 104 days). The extraction method used was the ISO 14240-2:1997. The total amount of radioactivity in the sediment layers was calculated from the amounts measured in the sediment extracts plus the amounts measured in the sediment solids after extraction. Supplementary extractions were performed to evaluate the potential to remove additional radiolabeled materials from the sediment solids. Supplemental extractions of the solids removed the equivalent of < 5 % of dosed radioactivity. (Protocol: OECD 308) (Ref VII) Justification of chosen degradation phrase: As DT50total system < 32 days with no clopidogrel detected by the end of the study, the correct phrase to use is: \"Clopidogrel is degraded in the environment\". Bioaccumulation Partition coefficient: Log Pow = 3.76 at pH 7 (US EPA & OECD 107) (Ref VIII) Justification of chosen bioaccumulation phrase: Since log Pow < 4 at pH 7, clopidgrel has low potential for bioaccumulation. Excretion (metabolism) Clopidogrel and its metabolites are excreted in urine and in feces; about 50% of an oral dose is recovered from the urine and about 46% from the feces. Metabolites identified are R‑130964 and SR26334. (Ref IX) The pharmacological activity of the metabolites is not known.

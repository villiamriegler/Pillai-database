        "env-effect": "Miljöinformationen för brinzolamid är framtagen av företaget Novartis för AZARGA, AZOPT, SIMBRINZA Miljörisk: Risk för miljöpåverkan av brinzolamid kan inte uteslutas då ekotoxikologiska data saknas. Nedbrytning: Det kan inte uteslutas att brinzolamid är persistent, då data saknas. Bioackumulering: Brinzolamid har låg potential att bioackumuleras. Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Environmental Risk Classification Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (μg/L) = (A*109*(100-R))/(365*P*V*D*100) = 1.37*10-6 * A * (100 - R) = 1.37*10-6 * 23.7 * 100 = 0.0032 μg/L Where: A = 23.6637 kg brinzolamide (total sold amount API in Sweden year 2021, data from IQVIA). R = 0 % removal rate (due to loss by adsorption to sludge particles, by volatilization, hydrolysis or biodegradation) = 0, if no data is available. P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 10 *106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (ECHA default) (ECHA 2008) D = factor for dilution of waste water by surface water flow = 10 (ECHA default) (ECHA 2008) Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) Ecotoxicological studies Algae: no data available Crustacean (Daphnia magna): no data available Fish: no data available Other ecotoxicity data: No data available PNEC derivation: No PNEC can be calculated since there is no environmental toxicity data available Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) Calculation of a risk ratio is not possible, due to the lack of environmental toxicity data. Therefore, the following phrase is used: \"Risk of environmental impact of brinzolamide cannot be ruled out as ecotoxicological data are missing.\" According to the European Medicines Agency guideline on environmental risk assessment of medicinal products (EMA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), use of brinzolamide is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment, because the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) at the time of registration was below the action limit 0.01 μg/L. Degradation Biotic degradation Ready degradability: no data available Justification of chosen degradation phrase: As no data on biological degradation is available the following phrase is used: ‘The potential for persistence of brinzolamide cannot be excluded, due to lack of data.’ Bioaccumulation Partitioning coefficient: logKow = 0.817 (method unknown) (Alcon Technical Report No. 136:60:0900) Justification of chosen bioaccumulation phrase: As log Kow < 4, the following statement is used for Brinzolamide: ‘Brinzolamide has low potential for bioaccumulation.’ Excretion (metabolism) Following topical or systemic administration, brinzolamide undergoes metabolic reactions that include N-dealkylation, O-dealkylation and oxidation of the N-propyl side chain, all CYP-450 catalyzed reactions. N-desethyl brinzolamide is the major metabolite of brinzolamide in primates and human whole blood and is the only quantifiable metabolite in human whole blood. (Alcon Technical Report No. 025:38570:0596, Alcon Technical Report No. 027:38570:0596, Alcon Technical Report No. 029:38570:0596, Alcon Technical Report No. 037:38570:0796) Studies with radioactive 14C-brinzolamide revealed that after 24 hours following an IV does, that approximately 50-60% of brinzolamide was excreted unchanged from the body and that approximately 42% remained in the blood and the carcass. (Alcon Technical Report No. 014:38570:0496) PBT/vPvB assessment Based on screening information, brinzolamide cannot be considered a potential PBT substance as the octanol-water partition coefficient remains significantly below the trigger level for a bioaccumulative substance.

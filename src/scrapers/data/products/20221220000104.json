        "env-effect": "Miljöinformationen för bosutinib är framtagen av företaget Pfizer för Bosulif, Bosulif® Miljörisk: Användning av bosutinib har bedömts medföra försumbar risk för miljöpåverkan. Nedbrytning: Bosutinib är potentiellt persistent. Bioackumulering: Bosutinib har låg potential att bioackumuleras. Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Biodegradation studies conducted in sludge indicate bosutinib will undergo minimal degradation during the wastewater treatment process. Based on a sludge sorption coefficient (Kd) of 3791, 38.5% removal through sorption to sludge during the wastewater treatment process may be expected. Upon release of wastewater effluents into the aquatic environment, bosutinib residues will reside in the water and sediment compartments. Based on aqueous dissipation half-lives of 1.1 and 5.9 days, bosutinib is expected to rapidly dissipate from the water to the sediment with approximately 30% to 41% becoming irreversibly bound. Degradation products observed in all sediment extracts, ranging from <10% to 21.7% of the dose, indicate that bosutinib is expected to undergo primary degradation in the sediment, however, the overall total system DT50 values were >100 days for the two water-sediment systems study, indicating that bosutinib may be persistent in the sediment compartment.

Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) PEC/PNEC = 6.10×10-4 / 3 = 2.03×10-4, i.e. PEC/PNEC ≤ 0.1 which justifies the phrase ”Use of bosutinib has been considered to result in insignificant environmental risk”. Degradation Biotic degradation Simulation studies (guideline OECD 308)17 Two sediments and their associated waters were utilized in a freshwater-sediment total system degradation study: Brandywine Creek (high organic content, 4.43%) and Choptank River (low organic content, 0.98%). Test systems were dosed with 14C-labeled bosutinib at a nominal concentration of 0.46 mg/L in the water layer. Test systems were incubated at approximately 20 ºC for up to 100 days, and maintained under aerobic conditions by gently bubbling air into the water layers. Bosutinib disappeared rapidly from the water layers in both Brandywine Creek and Choptank River test systems. The disappearance times of 50% of parent (DT50) from the water layers were 1.1 and 5.9 days, respectively. Most of the bosutinib migrated to the sediment layers. The fractions of radiolabeled residues that could not be extracted from the sediment layers at the end of the study were 40.6% and 30.1%, respectively. Sediments were extracted four times with THF+ 1% NH4OH. Supplemental extractions were performed using water, methanol or hexane, however the mean amount of 14C extracted from the solids was <10% for each solvent. The maximum amount of mineralisation or ultimate biodegradation observed was 0.0% and 0.2% for Choptank River and Brandywine Creek, respectively. At the end of the 100 day study, 0.0% and 0.2% of the parent compound applied radioactivity remained in the Brandywine Creek and Choptank River system, respectively. The mean amounts of the parent compound in the total test systems (water layers plus sediment extracts) at the end of the 100 day study were 50% and 48%, respectively. The overall DT50 and DT90 values for the total test systems is estimated to >180 days. WWTP degradation (guideline OECD 314B)18 An activated sludge biodegradation study was conducted to evaluate evaluate the rate and extent of primary biodegradation and mineralization of bosutinib in activated sludge, i.e. an estimation on the removal of bosutinib from wastewater. Samples were removed from the test vessels over a 28 day period. The conversion of radiolabeled test substance to 14CO2 was measured by trapping 14CO2 in base traps and quantifying dissolved 14CO2. Disappearance of parent test substance and the formation of metabolites were determined by radiochromatography. In addition, the sludge solids were combusted to determine the amount of radioactivity remaining with the solids. At the end of the study, 0.24% was mineralised into 14CO2 and 44.92% remained as non‑extractable residues in the solid phase. Parent compound remaining the end of the study was 38.10%. The solvent used to extract the mixed liquor samples was selected based on an extraction efficiency evaluation conducted prior to the start of the study. Four different solvents were evaluated (MeOH, ACN, EtOAc and H2O). MeOH in combination with H2O (water was included as an extraction solvent to recover very polar metabolites) provided the highest extraction efficiency and thus used in the study. Abiotic degradation Adsorption (guideline OECD 106)4 Test results from an adsorption-desorption study, show that bosutinib tends to adsorp to organic content, allowing for a greater amount of the parent compound to be handled in the WWTP and thus prevent release into the environment. Solid Kd (L/Kg) Koc (L/Kg) Activated sludge 3791 10 233 HOM sediment (BC) 5330 97 724 LOM sediment (CR) 2262 275 423 Using the formula (0.165×Kd) / (0.165×Kd + 1000) where 0.165 represents the grams of sludge wasted per 1000 grams of wastewater treatment plants' aqueous effluent, we can calculate the ratio removed by the WWTP. The Kd value for the activated sludge has been chosen as it most appropriately represents the conditions in a WWTP. Using the calculation (0.165×3791) / (0.165×3791 + 1000) = 0.3848 indicates that 38.48% of the active substance bosutinib is removed by the WWTP according to this study. Justification of chosen degradation phrase The simulation study shows that the substance is potentially persistent, seeing that a total system DT50 was estimated to >180 days. Therefore, the phrase “bosutinib is potentially persistent” is chosen. Bioaccumulation Bioconcentration factor (BCF) in Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus)11 Test results (guideline OECD 305) after 31 days of exposure to bosutinib, show a whole fish kinetic bioconcentration factor of 49 and 54 after a low-level (5.4 µg/L) and high-level (60 µg/L) exposure respectively. Following a depuration period of 60 days, the t1/2 was calculated to 23.3 and 24.2 days after a high-level and low-level exposure, respectively. Partitioning coefficient16 Log Dow = 1.09 at pH 5 (guideline OECD 107) Log Dow = 3.34 at pH 8 (guideline OECD 107) Justification of chosen bioaccumulation phrase Since BCF <500 and log Dow <4 at pH 7, the phrase ”bosutinib has low potential for bioaccumulation” is chosen. PBT/vPvB assessment Considering that log D is measured of having a maximum of 3.34 at pH 8 and that the measured BCF is <2000, and the lowest measured NOEC was 30 µg/L, bosutinib is not deemed to be a PBT or vPvB compound.

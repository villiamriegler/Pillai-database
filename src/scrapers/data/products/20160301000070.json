        "env-effect": "Miljöinformationen för ezetimib är framtagen av företaget Organon Sweden för Atozet, Ezetrol®, Inegy® Miljörisk: Användning av ezetimib har bedömts medföra försumbar risk för miljöpåverkan. Nedbrytning: Ezetimib är potentiellt persistent. Bioackumulering: Ezetimib har låg potential att bioackumuleras. Läs mer Detaljerad miljöinformation Detailed background information Studies of ezetimibe indicate it is poorly soluble in water (0.5 mg/L). Adsorption/desorption studies indicate ezetimibe is likely to bind to soils and sludge to some degree (log Koc range 3.6 to 4.4) The high octanol/water partition coefficient (log Kow > 4) suggested the potential to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms, however measured bioconcentration factors in bluegill sunfish ranged from 69 to 173, indicating a low potential for bioaccumulation [Ref X]. Environmental Risk Classification Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) PEC is calculated according to the following formula: PEC (μg/L) = (A*109*(100-R))/(365*P*V*D*100) = 1.37*10-6*A(100-R) PEC = 0.053 μg/L Where: A = 386.55 kg (total sold amount API in Sweden year 2022, data from IQVIA). Reduction of A may be justified based on metabolism data. R = 0 % removal rate (due to loss by adsorption to sludge particles, by volatilization, hydrolysis or biodegradation) = 0 if no data is available. (If R not equal to 0 this should be justified under the degradation section) P = number of inhabitants in Sweden = 10 *106 V (L/day) = volume of wastewater per capita and day = 200 (ECHA default) (Ref. I) D = factor for dilution of waste water by surface water flow = 10 (ECHA default) (Ref. I) Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) Ecotoxicological studies* Green Algae (Selenastrum capricornutum) (OECD 201) (Ref. II): EC50 72 h (density) = >0.3 mg/L EC50 72 h (growth rate) = >0.3 mg/L NOEC 72 h = 0.3 mg/L Non-toxic up to highest concentration tested Crustacean, water flea (Daphnia magna): Acute toxicity LC50 48 h (mortality) > 4 mg/L (OECD 202) (Ref. III) Non-toxic up to highest concentration tested Chronic toxicity NOEC 21 day (mortality; reproduction) = 0.3 mg/L (OECD 211) (Ref. IV) Non-toxic up to highest concentration tested Fish, fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas): Acute toxicity LC50 96 h (mortality) > 0.13 mg/L (OECD 203) (Ref. V) Non-toxic up to highest concentration tested Chronic toxicity NOEC 33 days (growth, total length) = 0.05 mg/L (OECD 210) (Ref. VI) Midge (Chironomus riparius) Chronic toxicity NOEC 28 days (growth) = 877mg/kg While significant shifting of this compound to the sediment is likely to occur, chronic toxicity tests with the midge (Chironomus riparius) indicate the compound is non-toxic to sediment dwelling organisms (21-day EC50 > 877 mg/kg, which is the highest concentration tested).(Ref XI) PNEC (μg/L) = 50/10 = 5 μg/L where 10 is the assessment factor used for three long-term ecotoxicity data endpoints. NOEC for fathead minnow has been used for this calculation since it is the most sensitive of the three tested species. Environmental risk classification (PEC/PNEC ratio) PEC/PNEC = 0.053/5 = 0.011, i.e. PEC/PNEC ratio < 1 which justifies the phrase ‘Use of Ezetimibe has been considered to result in insignificant long-term risk to the environment. Degradation* Biotic degradation Biodegradation Simulation Screening Test results 7% biodegradation to CO2 by Day 28. (OECD 301B) (Ref. VII) Test results 4% biodegradation to CO2 by Day 28; 83% biodegradation to metabolites (OECD 314) (Ref. VIII) Abiotic degradation Hydrolysis: Half-life of 4.5 days at pH 7, 25oC (OECD 111) (Ref. IX) Justification of chosen degradation phrase: Ezetimibe is inherently degradable in biological systems and via hydrolysis. However, as no data are available on the toxicity of the metabolites, the phrase “Ezetimibe is potentially persistent in the environment” is thus chosen. Bioaccumulation Bioconcentration Factor (BCF): Measured BCF values were 69 (low concentration) and 137 (high concentration) in a 97 day study with bluegill sunfish (OECD 305). (Ref. X) Justification of chosen bioaccumulation phrase: Since BCF < 500, the substance has low potential for bioaccumulation References ECHA, European Chemicals Agency. 2008 Guidance on information requirements and chemical safety assessment.
